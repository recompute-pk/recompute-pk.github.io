Earlier, he co-founded Pring, a “social network designed to be accessible to every Pakistani with a phone via offline SMS”. Given the insights he has developed over the years on what it takes to be a tech entrepreneur, his passion for technology, and his belief in its potential to bring social change, we invited him to our podcast series to explore his views on computing education and tech entrepreneurship. We also sneaked in a discussion on AI and computing education towards the end.\n  Can you tell us about your thought-process, how you managed to get into the startup space right after your undergrad, as majority of your cohort didn’t go down this route? My family tutor asked me when I was just 5 or 6 years old where I wanted to be when I grew up. Without hesitation, I told him I wanted to be an inventor. I was fascinated by the idea of creating and building things, and the entrepreneurial spirit that came with it. Seeing Bill Gates as a household name and the richest man in the world, thanks to his own mind and efforts (a simplistic story bought by a younger me), inspired me to follow a similar path. I co-founded an outsourcing company during college, and after graduation, I joined a friend\u0026rsquo;s training venture for the International Commission on Workforce Development. I\u0026rsquo;ve always been driven to make an impact and use my abilities to create something of my own.\nThe choice of electronics engineering and GIKI were also marked out with this future entrepreneur career in mind as well? When I was 17, I didn\u0026rsquo;t do much research on colleges. Like most kids my age, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a full understanding of the landscape. But I did know that GIKI was the number one engineering institute, at least according to a few international rankings. That\u0026rsquo;s why I chose it as my top choice. I had already been tinkering with electronics and building things like radios and circuits from scratch. I loved creating things, even making hydraulic and pneumatic systems with water-filled syringes and drip tubes. So, while I was a bit disappointed with the level of focus on electronics in the coursework, I still enjoyed it because of the course work. Eventually, I switched to computer science in my final year, but not before learning everything about Fourier transforms and more.\nIt seems that on the nature vs nurture spectrum, it was in your nature to be where you are. I\u0026rsquo;m personally inclined to the nurture side of the nature vs. nurture debate, and I have a few reasons for that. Growing up, my dad encouraged me to read a lot of science books, like the popular Tell Me Why and Did You Know series, which I still have today. He even bought me chemistry and electrical sets, which allowed me to build circuits from scratch. Living in Saudi Arabia at the time, it was difficult to find those types of resources, but my dad went to Pakistan to get them for me. He also went against the advice of others and bought me a computer in the 80s, which was a fairly expensive and uncommon thing to do at the time. The computer came with programming books, which allowed me to learn how to build games and other programs. Looking back, I realize that these experiences and resources gave me the opportunity to develop my creativity and skills as a builder. I also had a pretty cool Lego set that I used to spend hours building stuff up with. I believe that everyone has access to these types of signals (possibilities), but it\u0026rsquo;s up to us to listen and pick up on them in our own unique way.\nBesides your natural inclination and timely nudging by your parents, what did GIKI add to any of it? I remember a lunch we were having while at GIKI. The group was the best of the best. One of my friends, a typical Lahori, was being rowdy and telling a story about a speed race through a busy street. Everyone bought the story and were getting impressed, but then my friend from Bahrain asked, \u0026ldquo;But why?\u0026rdquo; It was the first time I realized that I never really questioned things and took them at face value. This was more due to the people I was around than the Institute itself. GIKI taught me to start critically thinking and questioning things which I previously would have accepted as true at face value. I learned to unlearn and challenge everything. It was at GIKI where I began to question more, thanks to the group of people who taught me to do so.\nThe kind of people that a university manages to put together, do you think that includes teachers as well, who helped to push you towards this direction? Throughout my life, I have had the privilege of encountering some truly remarkable individuals, especially during my time in school. Growing up in a religious household, I received a solid moral foundation from my family. However, I also had some exceptional teachers who left a lasting impression on me. These teachers genuinely cared about their students and instilled in us a strong moral compass. This continued in my college years at GIKI, where I encountered a few inspirational teachers who were able to capture my attention not just with their subject matter expertise, but also with their ability to make a personal connection. While building such connections may be more challenging in the age of Zoom, I was fortunate enough to have a few such teachers at GIKI who left a significant impact on me.\nWhat do you think is the fundamental role that a university ought to play in shaping its students, is it about creating good citizens or good software engineers? I understand that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in a complex topic that has many different aspects to it. Specifically, you\u0026rsquo;re asking about the problem with education and how it differs from other industries when it comes to measuring success. Unlike most industries, education\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;product\u0026rdquo; is the student, and success is measured by producing high-calibre students. However, this can be difficult to quantify since the end goal of a student getting a job is often disconnected from the education process.\nOne solution that has been implemented in the US is a centralized system that provides statistics on universities such as job placement rates, average income of graduates, and which fields they enter. This information can be used to make judgments about which institution to attend based on what is important to you. However, there is still a large disconnect between academia and industry, and this can lead to an alignment problem. In order to address this, institutes can follow up with their graduates and ask for feedback on how their education has helped them in their careers. This feedback loop is crucial in identifying what is working and what needs improvement. Unfortunately, many places do not have a strong feedback loop in place, which can hinder progress. I hope this helps clarify the issue for you!\nWhen it comes to industrial involvement, there is a value chain to consider. For instance, many Indian companies started with outsourcing, particularly in business processes like call centres. Such roles don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily require a four-year degree but rather specific skills such as communication, product knowledge, and basic IT training. This formed the foundation of the business process outsourcing industry in India. As individuals progress along the value chain, they may move from answering calls to making calls, sales, and eventually into managerial or strategic positions. The skill requirements and the level of thinking increase as they move up. On the academic side, lower-value functions may focus on specific tools or technical skills. However, as one moves towards higher-value functions, the importance of higher education and critical thinking becomes more evident.\nPsychological safety plays a crucial role in fostering a culture of learning from mistakes and promoting innovation. Unfortunately, in countries like Pakistan, there is often a fear of failure and a lack of openness about mistakes. This inhibits growth and stifles creativity. In our own company, we prioritize critical thinking skills and value the ability to learn from and admit mistakes. Building startups is akin to the scientific method, where observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and honest evaluation are essential. Psychological safety allows individuals to share their mistakes without fear of punishment, fostering a culture of growth and improvement.\nWhen it comes to higher education, the need for a four-year degree depends on the specific role and value chain. Low-value roles like call centers may not require extensive formal education, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t diminish their importance. However, as one ventures into higher-value functions, such as creation, innovation, and original thought, higher education becomes increasingly relevant. Pakistan, and many other countries, need more creators and artists to drive progress in the 21st century.\nI believe education should be tailored to individual needs and interests. Mastery learning, where students must fully grasp a concept before moving forward, can be more effective than traditional one-size-fits-all approaches. With modern technology and platforms like Khan Academy, personalized and self-paced learning is possible. Universities can embrace this approach by curating the best educational content, utilizing learning management systems, and facilitating group problem-solving. Combining top-quality online resources with peer collaboration and facilitation from teachers can create a more dynamic and effective learning environment.\nI had the opportunity to witness the implementation of such an approach at a school in the US, where they integrated Khan Academy into their curriculum. The school used online lectures and problem-solving sessions in groups to enhance learning. Teachers could track students' progress and provide targeted support. I believe this blended model, combining high-quality content with collaborative problem-solving, is the way forward for education in the modern world.\nThere are websites like LeetCode that focus on coding problems for software job applications. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because it aligns with the concept of machine-based learning you mentioned earlier. You\u0026rsquo;re given coding problems and work on solving them, aiming for an efficient solution with the least complexity. These platforms allow multiple attempts and provide better solutions for comparison. It reminds me of competency-based learning, where you strive for mastery and keep going until you achieve competency at each level. It\u0026rsquo;s different from traditional exams where you pass once and move on. The ability to keep working on assessments until you reach a certain level is intriguing. I\u0026rsquo;ve always found this approach fascinating. In my opinion, a university\u0026rsquo;s primary responsibility should be to provide education, but I often see universities prioritize grading and assessment over actual learning. Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t students be allowed to retake midterms if they are improving their grades? There should be more flexibility within a semester timeframe. Currently, resubmitting homework assignments is not allowed in many cases, which can be discouraging for students. However, I hope that with the rise of technology, platforms like AI-powered checkers can assist in grading assignments and assessments. As long as students understand that assessments are meant for their own learning and there are no penalties for mistakes, we can shift the focus towards a more enriching educational experience rather than solely assessment-based learning. Currently, the focus seems to be primarily on assessments, which I think discourages many students and creates a fear of failure. Penalizing failure only pushes students away instead of fostering a supportive and growth-oriented learning environment.\nAssessments, when done the right way, can indeed be a valuable tool in the learning process. The key is to ensure that assessments are not just seen as checkboxes or hurdles to overcome, but rather as opportunities for students to personalize their learning journey. Imagine if you were only given one chance to take a test or submit an assignment on Khan Academy or any other platform. It would create unnecessary pressure and restrict your ability to learn and improve. Instead, what if we removed the penalties and allowed for multiple attempts? By shifting the focus from grades to learning, we can raise the minimum level of understanding and create a more supportive environment. I believe the goal should be to provide a continuous learning experience where assessments serve as opportunities for growth rather than permanent judgments. It would be ideal to reduce or eliminate the negative consequences associated with assessments, fostering a culture of learning and development.\nI find it fascinating how you brought up the recurring theme of the scientific method and connected it to entrepreneurship. It\u0026rsquo;s true that universities can benefit from adopting a more entrepreneurial mindset in their approach. They seem to have become less inclined to experiment and explore new ideas, instead favoring standardization. I believe there is great value in approaching education with a mindset of constant experimentation, always seeking new hypotheses to explore. By embracing this approach, universities can stay innovative and adapt to the changing needs of students and society. Entrepreneurialism has a way of amplifying the essence of the scientific method. It introduces a sense of urgency and resource constraints, where each experiment carries a potential penalty. The limited availability of time, funds, and resources means that wrong turns can be costly and impede progress. However, in the context of a university, it becomes a safe space for experimentation and exploration, allowing students to push their limits and discover what resonates with them. While there may be an artificial aspect to this protected environment, I agree that it provides an opportunity to stretch boundaries and unleash potential. This notion extends beyond academia, as we see the application of the scientific method in various realms, from national conversations prompting legislation to individual feedback loops. Even without a specifically entrepreneurial focus, fostering feedback loops within education is crucial. Asking students about their experiences, what they\u0026rsquo;ve learned, and how they have benefited creates a valuable feedback loop that entrepreneurs excel at. Embracing this aspect can benefit everyone involved.\nUniversity has been a traditional institution with a handful of lucky students learning in a classroom setting with a teacher giving them their human attention, but with the growing population, do you think they need to redesign universities so that they can engage with more students at scale? Like Khan Academy has worked out something with the help of content creators and integrated mastery learning through technology. Scaling is no longer an issue when it comes to personalized education. Thanks to tools like Learning Management Systems (LMS), individual attention and scalability can coexist. As a student, you can benefit from automated systems that closely monitor your progress and assess where everyone stands within the assessments. This allows for the creation of customized learning groups, such as those needing additional attention or support. Even on an individual level, the curriculum can be tailored to address specific needs. While human intervention remains crucial, it can be scaled through effective grouping and peer collaboration. By partnering with commercial content creators and leveraging platforms like YouTube, educational institutions can tap into a wealth of diverse and localized resources. The power of technology, including AI, further enables translation, question generation, and assessment. With the right technology and strategies, scaling personalized education becomes not only feasible but also an effective approach. Even for a class of 5,200, a single teacher should be able to implement mastery learning. The possibilities are within reach. Epistemology, the study of information and knowledge, encompasses the concept of knowledge graphs. These graphs resemble hierarchical trees, where one concept builds upon another. Khan Academy has successfully constructed such a tree, which identifies the prerequisites for each concept in a structured manner. A renowned teaching method, known as the Richard Feynman method, emphasizes the importance of understanding through continuous rewriting and simplification. It involves breaking down complex terms into easier, substitute parts that are more accessible to learners of different grade levels. Open-source resources play a significant role in curriculum design, making relevant content widely available. For instance, when teaching my son a mathematical concept, we found informative videos on platforms like YouTube and Google, featuring engaging animations and even instruction in our native language. As a parent, my main goal is to instill in my children the ability to learn independently. Minecraft, a virtual construction game, has proven to be an excellent learning tool for them. They watch educational videos from creators, absorb knowledge while playing, and apply the same methodology to other educational games. This shift towards interactive and immersive learning experiences is an exciting trend that facilitates self-directed learning, and I believe this is where things are moving now.\nHow does a university or its professors develop an entrepreneurial mindset in their students? When I have conversations with aspiring entrepreneurs, I often encounter individuals who approach me with an idea and a plea for assistance in building a company around it. However, starting with just an idea is not the most effective approach. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to begin by identifying a problem. For instance, let\u0026rsquo;s consider the issue of pick-up and drop-off services. If you personally face this problem and develop a fractional car-sharing service like Uber or Careem to address it, you create a solution that benefits all those experiencing the same challenge. Conversely, if you start with an idea and then try to find a problem to solve, you risk creating a solution in search of a problem. This approach puts you several steps behind. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to start with the problem itself. Moreover, it is advisable to choose a problem you have encountered firsthand, as it allows you to shortcut the validation process and make informed decisions. This validation process, known as customer development methodology, involves customer discovery and validation stages. It is a fundamental framework coined by Professor Dr. Steve Blank. Additionally, you may come across the concept of Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which is also popular in the entrepreneurial sphere. These methods and frameworks provide valuable insights and guidance in the pursuit of building successful ventures.\nWhy are most of our universities producing computer scientists/software engineers who don’t come up to the expectations of the industry, which they could even remaining within traditional educational pedagogy? I believe the issue here is closely tied to the value chain. Even within a software company, we can break it down into three levels. At the entry level, you may need engineers who can efficiently follow specifications and work on specific components. Then there is the mid-level where design and architecture play a crucial role in selecting the right technologies and making informed decisions. Lastly, at the highest level, you require individuals with advanced thinking and extensive experience to create solutions from scratch. While universities often excel at the entry and mid-levels, there is a significant gap when it comes to nurturing talent for the highest level. In the past, there was a vacuum in the industry for such skilled individuals, but recently, we have seen progress in addressing this gap.\nMoreover, there is a challenge in retaining highly skilled professionals in Pakistan. Many talented individuals are attracted to opportunities in places like Silicon Valley, where they can earn higher salaries and tap into their full potential. The local companies in Pakistan traditionally did not offer comparable compensation for the level of expertise required. Additionally, there has been a lack of funding to support higher-level thinking and innovation. This complex problem calls for a comprehensive approach, considering both the industry\u0026rsquo;s investment in talent and the students' aspirations.\nAlthough Pakistan has successfully produced high-quality graduates who excel in export-oriented industries, the question remains about the long-term impact. If we analyze the graduating batches of LUMS or GIKI from the past decade, we observe that less than 5% choose to stay in Pakistan, and even those who do often feel compelled to do so due to circumstances rather than personal preference. Factors such as job prospects, quality of life, and opportunities for growth influence their decisions.\nTo address this issue, it is essential to examine the industry\u0026rsquo;s opportunities and create an environment that attracts and retains talent. Industry leaders and policymakers must collaborate to provide the necessary resources, funding, and support for advanced-level thinking and innovation within Pakistan. By creating a thriving ecosystem that offers competitive compensation, stimulating work, and a vibrant tech community, we can encourage talented individuals to stay and contribute to the growth and success of the country.\nThank you for a refreshing and nuanced analysis, otherwise almost always in the university-academia debate in Pakistan, it is only the universities that come out looking bad. But can also tell us the reason why you have your entire product team located in Pakistan instead of Silicon Valley, is it because of cheap labor? The reason we initially started in Pakistan was simply because I was based there, so it was more of an organic decision. However, as we began building our product and expanding our client base, we faced challenges in finding individuals with the necessary expertise and experience within Pakistan. This led us to eventually hire people from the Silicon Valley, such as our partner designer who had worked at prestigious companies like Microsoft and Google.\nIn Pakistan, there are certain areas where we have found exceptional talent, particularly in fields like marketing and selling software to the Western market. For example, there is a large company in Pakistan that has a 500-person outbound sales team focused on trucking, demonstrating the potential of the local workforce. However, finding highly skilled individuals for specialized roles can be more challenging.\nOne advantage of working in Pakistan is the cost benefit, especially for a company like ours that involves connecting with numerous systems. The sheer number of hours required to accomplish this task makes Pakistan a cost-effective option compared to San Francisco. Additionally, with advancements in AI, the role of humans in certain tasks is evolving, and they are now supervising AI systems that enhance productivity.\nRegarding compensation, we have adopted a policy of paying in dollars in Pakistan to ensure our employees are adequately rewarded for their skills. In 2022, there was a significant decline in the local currency\u0026rsquo;s value, so we made it a priority to protect our employees against this fluctuation. My belief is that if an engineer in Pakistan is as talented as an engineer in San Francisco, they should receive comparable compensation. Birthplace should not determine one\u0026rsquo;s worth or earning potential.\nIn summary, while there are challenges in finding specific skill sets within Pakistan, we have also encountered exceptional talent. We aim to provide equal compensation for equivalent skills, irrespective of geographical location, and to ensure that employees are fairly rewarded for their contributions.\nYou mentioned the scientific method and the importance of reality checks and feedback loops, but in academia, an earlier guest, Dr. Ali Khayyam identified that the incentives for taking the feedback seriously are missing. It seems Pakistani universities have no stakes in the fact that their graduates aren’t getting recruited. Universities are getting away with lousy or irrelevant teaching. How does one go about creating this feedback loop and then perhaps shortening it? The question you raised is indeed a challenging one. In the Silicon Valley, there is an innovative model known as the polytechnic norm, where high-quality training is provided free of charge. Once students secure a job above a certain salary threshold, a fraction of their income is used to repay the investment made in their training. This model aligns the employer with the educational institution. While this approach has been successful for shorter programs, it may not directly apply to a four-year degree.\nIn the absence of such models, marketing becomes crucial. Promoting institutes and collecting data on graduates' placements can help provide transparency and insights into the success of students. Institutes can partner with companies to gather information on the career paths and outcomes of their graduates. By measuring placement ratios and success within a specific timeframe, institutes can focus on student achievements rather than operational metrics.\nImplementing such transparency measures may be challenging, but it is crucial for the betterment of students. Institutes must be sincere in their efforts to assist students and communicate their intentions effectively. Marketing and promoting these initiatives can help foster trust and encourage participation. Ultimately, it requires dedication and a willingness to improve educational outcomes, and there are no inherent obstacles preventing institutes from adopting feedback-based systems.\nYou’ve already mentioned that in your company you are not just hiring for hardcore tool or a specific programming language competency only, you mentioned that you’re also looking for graduates with critical thinking abilities. If you can expand on that a little in this podcast perhaps more people from industry would follow suit, and perhaps more people in academia would take this “soft” skill more seriously. When it comes to evaluating graduates, we take into account their four-year journey. Our company has always operated as a distributed organization since its inception in 2017. Therefore, we place great importance on effective communication skills. In our interview process, we assess spoken English proficiency, clarity of expression, and the ability to communicate effectively. We also evaluate raw intelligence and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, we delve into the candidate\u0026rsquo;s specific area of expertise and inquire about their work history, looking for signs of growth and impact. For fresh graduates, we explore their extracurricular activities or hobbies related to their field of study. This is generally our evaluation process, and while I can provide more details about certain aspects, it is crucial to consider who is asking these questions. If you’re a call center, for instance, there may be a focus on English-speaking graduates, which is addressed through English courses offered by many institutions. It is important for the industry, whether through organizations like PASHA or the labor board, to provide aggregate data on the demand for different roles.\nUniversities should define their goals clearly. They need to determine whether they aim to produce individuals for higher education, cater to the industry, or pursue a balance of both. It is essential to conduct market research and anticipate the industry\u0026rsquo;s needs for the next 5 to 15 years. While timeless skills like philosophy or critical thinking remain important, practical implementation through tools and hands-on experience is equally crucial. Hiring processes should eventually assess a candidate\u0026rsquo;s ability to get things done based on their past performance.\nAs an educational institution, having a clear purpose and measuring outcomes is vital. Whether the focus is on fueling the local industry, contributing to higher education, or both, optimization should align with the intended goals. Not having a defined measure in place would be less effective than having a well-defined approach to evaluate and meet the demands of the market.\nIs there a high correlation between those who do well in your critical thinking assessment in your interview process and the GPA that the students come to the interview with? In my opinion, the significance of a GPA may vary depending on the institute and its grading system. Different institutions have different distributions and standards for GPAs. When I interview graduates, I always ask them about their GPA, regardless of whether it is high or low. The question I pose to them is, \u0026ldquo;Why is it so low?\u0026rdquo; This query aims to gauge their response and their level of transparency. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in their ability to take ownership, show accountability, and engage in self-reflection. A good answer would involve acknowledging personal factors such as lack of study or interest. However, a poor answer would involve blaming external factors like bad teachers or a subpar institute. So, while GPAs can vary, it\u0026rsquo;s more important for candidates to provide valid reasons and demonstrate their growth and achievements in their first job or position, which often carry more weight than academic performance.\nDid you have a good GPA in your undergrad? When I started my journey, my initial plan was to pursue computer science, but I ended up choosing electronics instead, which turned out to be okay. Even before that, I had a strong desire to dive into practical academia and build things, including my own company. I started taking on various projects and even took charge of revamping the institute\u0026rsquo;s website. Programming became a major part of my life, and I remember a funny incident during my first semester. There was a computer science course with a lab, and I dedicated an entire month, working eight hours a day, to create a 3D game from scratch using Turbo C, which was popular at the time. I developed my own engine and driver for the game. When it came time to present our projects, while others were showcasing simple games, I presented a fully functional 3D game like Doom. The faculty was impressed and gave me a standing ovation. However, this deep dive into programming led me to get somewhat sidetracked from other subjects. Nevertheless, by the time I graduated, I had gained experience in around 42 different programming languages to some extent. It may not be the best excuse, but it\u0026rsquo;s the story I would share with my parents when they ask about my academic journey\nYou’ve mentioned that the best graduates are those with both a philosophical outlook as well as technically competent, if we were living in Nash universe, what curriculum would you set in your university in order to produce such graduates? I must admit that answering this question fully is quite challenging, and I may not be the most qualified person to do so. However, when it comes to essential skills, I believe that critical thinking, effective communication, and strong reasoning abilities are foundational. These skills go beyond just coding or scientific principles and are applicable to various disciplines. Unfortunately, many people are not explicitly taught how to learn and develop these skills. As children, we are taught to focus but not necessarily how to focus or what it truly means. Those who excel academically often have the advantage of observing older siblings or receiving guidance from parents on how to debug problems and learn effectively. However, the ability to learn quickly and adapt is now more important than ever, and it is a skill that needs to be nurtured throughout one\u0026rsquo;s education. I recall a conversation with one of our product designers who asked me about the future of their field. In response, I emphasized the significance of their ability to learn quickly and adapt. As knowledge workers, we all face an infinite task list and limited time, so prioritization becomes crucial. Focusing on high-leverage activities that provide ongoing value is essential. For example, creating an educational video on YouTube is a high-leverage activity because it can reach a wide audience without the need for repetitive explanations. As one progresses in their career and gains more seniority, high-leverage activities often involve managing resources and executing strategic initiatives. Embracing AI and new tools is also important, as they can augment our capabilities and help us achieve more in less time. Ultimately, the most critical skill for individuals to learn is how to effectively leverage tools and technologies to advance their goals. This is a skill that can be taught early on but should also be emphasized at the university level to ensure students are prepared to navigate a rapidly changing world.\nAI at scale is still a relatively new phenomenon, where do you see this going when it comes to education and industry? It\u0026rsquo;s still early days, making it challenging to fully grasp all the implications. In my opinion, it will take several years, perhaps three to five, to truly understand the myriad ways in which AI can be utilized and the impact it can have. The field of AI extends far beyond computer science and finds applications across various domains. One interesting aspect I mentioned earlier is how AI can act as a foundational layer, enabling individuals to conform to specifications and become more productive. However, this could also lead to a shift in job roles, with the bottom layer potentially being replaced by AI, necessitating upskilling for those previously in that layer. As a result, everyone might become more like problem engineers, focusing on how to ask the right questions and generate solutions. This idea aligns with a long-standing challenge in the software profession, where software interviews often fall short. The question arises whether allowing access to tools like Google during assessments would provide a more realistic evaluation of problem-solving abilities. Some companies already utilize take-home assignments or open-source problems to assess candidates, acknowledging the value of mimicking real-life scenarios. Incorporating AI into such assessments is a question that warrants further consideration. While it\u0026rsquo;s challenging to predict all the potential applications of AI, it should be seen as an additional tool in our repertoire, similar to a powerful calculator. Initially, schools may discourage calculator use in math to foster understanding, but as we progress, leveraging tools like calculators becomes more acceptable. Similarly, AI can be seen as a tool that aids our problem-solving abilities. However, we must remain cautious as AI\u0026rsquo;s capabilities and potential implications continue to evolve. It\u0026rsquo;s an ongoing journey, and there\u0026rsquo;s still much to explore and understand. You know how they say that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. There’s going to be the AI tools which can at least do half of that perspiration for you, so that’s going to be great for those who want to create or build stuff, but those at the bottom of the hierarchy of learning, they will have to retool themselves, just like calculators and computers were both terms for people who used to perform manual calculations and computations. Imagine how they must have adapted, given that the mechanical calculators and computers came into being.\nAny last word, especially if there’s something that you feel got missed out in our conversation today? I believe we\u0026rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground and touched on many important points. One piece of advice I would give to students is not to rely solely on their university education. Often, if everyone in your field follows the same path, their profiles end up looking quite similar. To stand out, it\u0026rsquo;s beneficial to gain exposure and practical experience outside of the university setting. This can be as simple as dedicating a few hours per week to activities that enhance your communication skills or exploring processes and finances by working on real-world projects. Some of the best students I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered had a couple of years of experience under their belt because they had been involved in internships or part-time work. This practical experience made them more competitive in the job market compared to entry-level applicants. There are certainly opportunities out there for those willing to seize them. It\u0026rsquo;s important to strike a balance between gaining real-world experience and staying focused on your educational goals. If you can carve out some time during your student life, I believe it\u0026rsquo;s a great way to jumpstart your career. Another piece of advice is to research the companies or organizations you aspire to work for. Look at their job postings and descriptions to identify the specific skills they require. Take the initiative to learn about those skills and technologies through short courses or self-study. By doing so, you\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate your proactive approach and show potential employers that you have a solid understanding of their industry. These are just a few suggestions I have for students seeking to differentiate themselves and make meaningful progress in their careers.\n","date":1679097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679097600,"objectID":"afbc4d32f89da30262758dc32f033470","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast09-nasrullah/","publishdate":"2023-03-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/podcast09-nasrullah/","section":"post","summary":"Mohammad Nasrullah, “Nash” for people who know him, is a technologist who has started multiple tech companies, and is currently the CEO of “Integry”, another company he founded.

Hear his journey, thought process and golden advice for those who are in the business of improving the state of academic affairs.\n  Can you say something about your professional journey, leading up to where you are now? I’ll just share parts of it. I worked as a hardware engineer for two years after my graduation. After that I did my masters and PhD from Michigan State university in the US, in electrical engineering. One week after completing my degree I was back to Pakistan teaching at NUST Islamabad, due to a scholarship bond. I stayed there for 5 years and established a research lab, built a graduate EE program from scratch. My research lab was going really well, and had really brilliant students, most of whom are done with their PhDs and are doing well in academia themselves, or some even doing great in industry all over the world. But the truth is that I was getting restless as I thought that I’m exploring a very narrow scope of impact. Somehow, through the platform of NUST, I started consulting for some Silicon Valley companies, even involving my students, and from there on one thing led to another, and by the time my tenure track position’s discussions started at NUST, I had taken the decision to quit from NUST and academia.\nWe do know that you had officially received best teacher as well as best researcher awards and recognition, both at university as well as HEC levels. You were consistently publishing cutting edge work at the best research venues, you were producing great students from your classes as well as research lab. Why do you maintain that you were having little or no impact, while any academician today would give a leg to achieve in their lifetime what you managed to do in just 5 years? It was a privilege getting the best teacher and researcher awards two years in a row, and indeed our research was top-notch, that’s where I had set the bar for myself as well as for my students. The type of conferences and journals we were successfully targeting and publishing at, were at par in terms of both quality as well as quantity, when compared with what I was doing in the US, as well as what I would have managed to do if I had been an academician in the US. We had reasonable funding too, but I soon realized that the real impact is the impact I had on my students, but through my research setup, I was only helping train a handful of students, who even got admissions in world class universities, based on what they did in my research lab. Having said that, the real impact was in teaching where I could impact hundreds of students, but sadly, the hierarchical structures within our universities give no respect to those faculty members who want to do just great teaching – they are a nobody in academia. If NUST had let me just teach, I probably would have stayed, but I wasn’t satisfied with the minimal impact my research was having, I wanted to do something else with my time, as I soon realized that the proxy of impact factor isn’t what impact really is, and I had the biggest impact factor and citation indices when I quit academia, by a margin, at the time.\nDo you think it is because of the kind of person you are that helped you recognize the limited view of impact possible in academia, not just in Pakistan, but anywhere in the academic world, or do you think there’s something fundamentally wrong with the reward and recognition or academic structures that’s causing this limitation? There’s something fundamentally broken in the system, the incentives and rewards are not tied to something that the people should really be doing. Your product is your student, and the student that you teach. But there’s this rush to publish and publish more is not helping to move the needle. Even when it comes to research, academia is not really working on problems that are to make any impact in the world. In the best conferences of the world, there’s increasingly less contributions made by academia and it is the industry that’s sharing with the world the interesting research problems they are addressing. The incentive in academia to publish more is a wrong direction, which clearly isn’t the bottom line in industry. I know there’s still some professors who publish one paper after every few years, but they tell the world something of real consequence, which then has an impact in the wider society as well. But these professors are hard to come by now. If you ask the majority of professors to stack-rank their priorities, at the top would come their publications and research, then their grants and grant writing activities, then their services that push towards promotion, and perhaps the teaching gets the fourth spot. This is what is fundamentally broken, and is such a disservice to the academicians as well as the students.\nIt’s great that you’ve mentioned how and what is fundamentally wrong with the mis-aligned incentive structures and priorities throughout the academic world, but still do you think there’s something that is unique to the Pakistani academia or magnified here? For a tenure, it’s a dog eat dog world anywhere, but I would say the issues get more magnified in Pakistan. On the one hand are our professors who have created many bypasses and hooks to get promoted, given the policies and structures. But the dilemma is that on the other hand are those who are vocal against the phenomena taking place around publications and promotions, but neither publish anything credible and yet suck at teaching. So, if you’re not publishing, at least you have got to be killing it at teaching. So the bad system is being abused by most people, to the effect that there’s hardly any inspiration going on in the classrooms. Ever since I left academia, I think things have gotten worse, as I keep observing the deteriorating quality of Pakistani graduates, as I’m in the privileged position of hiring in the industry. So those who criticize the research eco-system and yet don’t put in time and are bad at teaching should simply be fired, there’s no excuse for it. My anecdotal evidence from the US suggests that the best of the teachers around me were best at research too. Even some of them, with only a Masters degree, were far better at teaching than many of the PhDs combined, but I believe the situation in Pakistan is abusive, at least such a bad teaching record (with bad research record) would get you fired in the US. Honestly, you cannot suck at both teaching and research, you can suck at one of them, you can be a great teacher and suck at research or you can be a great researcher and suck at teaching, but in Pakistan people are getting away with sucking at both.\nYou identified, and quite rightly, that the real impact in academia is through great teaching in classrooms and not through research, but then you took a flight to the industry. How did that come about? I wanted to teach, and I wanted to build things people would actually use, and I wanted to be able to pay the bills at home, so instead of doing more academic research I joined the industry. But on the side, I’m still sitting on various university committees, funding education related startups, and even doing education related podcasts such as this one. But my beef with academia is that they wouldn’t let me teach, with dignity.\nYou’ve rightly identified that the priorities of academia world-over have been turned upside down, and that especially in Pakistan things get more perverse, but given the younger universities and being small-sized too, compared to old and big institutions abroad, the real chance of changing these priorities is in a place like Pakistan. And it would take a credible academician like you to put your weight behind a corrective policy and get it approved through the vertical hierarchies. Have you made any attempts at changing the faculty policies for a positive change? You’re right, the more an institution is old and/or big, the harder it is to change. Hence, my hope lies with younger, smaller places. When I was in Pakistan, there were a few such places, e.g. I spent a lot of time with Namal and its faculty at the initial stages, and I saw hope there. I’m not sure what’s the situation now, but I can tell you about NUST. When I was a student, we had the best of professors, when I joined as a faculty member, they were lesser in proportion, and from the quality of graduates, anyone in the world can now tell that progressively the proportion of quality of great professorship has gone down. I don’t have hope anymore from our universities as an institution, as every institution is looking for more money and everyone is just waiting for someone to come and save the institution. However, I do have hope from the young startups in the ed-tech space, they have the right talent to upskill the students, and these Pakistani ed-tech startups are aiming at changing the quality of teaching at school, college, and university levels.\nHEC does end up taking a lot of flak for bad policies, but at least some years back they were trying to do the right thing by setting minimal acceptable standards for academic research. I’m not sure what’s happening there these days. When I was in Pakistan, I didn’t even look at HEC’s promotion criteria, I had my own yardstick, and I just knew that my yard stick would be far better and of course would make me eligible for HEC’s minimal quality and quantity bars.\nIf you were the sole administrator (at HEC), what is that one minimal thing that you would change in a university system, which will force everything else to fall in line? I would make the decision for funding of a university proportional to the employability of their students! All money and ranking incentives would be tied to the rate of undergrad, grad and PhD students employed on the day of the completion of their respective degrees. This one measurement would fix the whole system, and this was in my presentation to the HEC in 2015.\nSpeaking of measurements, our universities are fond of measuring all sorts of quantities, yet they choose to not measure this one thing that matters. Instead, they are fixated on research, and there too, on quantity, their working assumption being that let them climb the ranks based on more and more quantity of mediocre work and then they’ll think about quality. Sadly, it doesn’t work that way. By the time one has climbed up the ranks, mediocrity has been habituated and institutionalized.\nShould only a few universities start a MS and PhD program while most should only focus on a good undergrad program? We have an absolutely unforgiving education system for the students where one bad exam anywhere during one’s Matric, FSc, or O/A levels is sufficient to set them back, so that a student can’t get admission in the top undergrad universities of Pakistan. Hence, an MS provides that level-playing opportunity for many such students, and at NUST my experience speaks to this reality. Some of the best grad students I’ve had did their undergrad from places nobody had heard of. But MS and PhD program sizes should be strictly regulated since the best faculty in Pakistan has limited time and space for their intellectual bandwidth. But having said that, let me re-emphasize that your MS and PhD students should be absolutely employable too. At NUST, we had a terrible experience interviewing a faculty candidate who had done his PhD in signal processing and the guy didn’t know the fundamentals of Gaussian distribution and its mean. In short, the employability statistic is even a great indicator of the quality of your PhD program, so that programs that churn out people with terrible fundamentals can be checked.\nAt University of Glasgow, besides the regular career tracks for the faculty, the policies also have a clear promotion path for a Teaching and Learning scholarship, in which faculty members are invested in doing research on the education side of academia and publishing likewise. Namal is trying to explore a more holistic spectrum of scholarly activities in their appraisal policy, apart from publishing at HEC recognized journals. What do you think of such initiatives? It makes a lot of sense and I hope HEC can take that policy direction too. For instance, in US there’s the famous Physicist at Harvard, Eric Mazur, who was a hard-core physicist but is now a hard-core educator and one of the best teachers who’s inspired not just a lot of students but imagine the impact of one man, that his classroom teaching experiments around peer instruction and active learning have helped in scaling up the whole enterprise of MOOCs. It goes in a university’s favor that they encourage and make room for such kind of scholarship and societal impact.\nBtw, I also mentor and help secure funding for anyone who wants to explore this ed-tech space. If anyone listening wants to, feel free to drop me a line and we’ll see where it goes!\nIf we continue your professional journey, please walk us through what happened after your transition from NUST to the industry. After NUST I co-founded a startup in the computer networks domain, which later got acquired by another Silicon Valley based startup, and further down the road that got acquired by VMware, but I remained the engineering lead throughout and built great teams from scratch, eventually moved from Islamabad to Lahore to US, Palo Alto. Then moved to Amazon Web Services as they were looking for cloud-based expertise, and as GM got a chance to not just build great engineering teams but also great front-facing service features which were designed and pitched by me. Just recently, I left AWS too, as I wanted to work on my own ideas and wanted more leverage, so as the founder of a stealth mode startup working on that at the moment, still in the US.\nAmazon operates at scale, in terms of their service as well as the pool of talent they have employed, West has Google and Facebook type of software giants, similarly, India has huge software houses, why is it that Pakistan does not have that kind of scale either for software houses or even startups? I don’t think it is a hopeless situation, but the points of comparison should be fairer. Some management people, when they came back from a visit to the US, wanted to declare NUST as Stanford and Islamabad as Silicon Valley. We have about 20 years of catching up to do before we can compare ourselves with India. But we will get there, both in terms of technology as well as scale. 8 years back people used to talk about whether Pakistan will ever be able to have a billion-dollar startup, this past year has already seen that happening. In terms of ecosystem, we have venture capital investment taking roots in Pakistan, which was absolutely missing till a few years back. Software export is hitting the 5 billion mark. The Pakistani tech employees were much cheaper in cost compared with the rest of the world 7 years ago, but today they are competing in terms of salaries. Our top talent is also getting recruited now by European and US software companies. These are all the ingredients that go in our favor, and in the making of the right ecosystem. The companies within Pakistan do not have to compete with Amazon, Google, or Facebook for recruiting our top graduates. As in the West the software giants end up attracting almost all the top talent. So, the financial capital is available in Pakistan, human capital we always had since there’s a huge population, so the software houses end up getting talented people, these kids are successful not because of their universities, but in spite of them. These are all the right ingredients, and it is only a matter of time before things blossom in terms of scale, both in terms of revenue as well as talented people.\nLet’s say some years down the road Pakistan plans to and does manage to set up the ecosystem for billion-dollar software companies, working backwards from it, what do the universities need to do today so that the ecosystem is also made possible because of how they train the graduates not in spite of it? Like I said, the professors need to a) not suck at both teaching and research, b) professors need to start working with the industry and not continuously keep falling behind. The universities need to start performance management, so that those professors who suck at both need to be laid off. Instead, hire great talent from the industry who have done their masters, instead of hiring ordinary folks just because they have done a PhD. Lastly, universities need to learn how to retain their best faculty members. LUMS is a slight exception, other than that there’s hardly any university that has managed to retain talented faculty members. NUST has lost so many, Namal has lost so many. It’s just a qualitatively deep discussion one gets to have with people who are really good at their jobs. But unfortunately, the universities have developed a mindset that a doctor is a doctor, if not this PhD, then another, it makes no difference to them. This is where the universities could do better, but right now, they don’t have any incentive to improve because of the population dynamics and because people will keep sending them their kids.\nSince you’re involved in hiring for the industry, and you must have seen graduates from Pakistan as well as from the rest of the world, is there any marked difference between them? I’ve had the opportunity to build and hire teams not just in Pakistan and the US, but also in Ireland, Romania and Australia. Nobody hires an undergrad because they know a lot about a lot, but we hire them because their foundations are sound. And that’s where the difference lies, unfortunately. Graduates from Pakistan have much weaker foundations when compared with their counterparts from Europe and US. But on the positive side, our students’ potential is far better than others, we’ll be slow and take our time to catch up (because of foundational issues) but then on, we will crush and thrive in the enabling environment. This only means that if Pakistan manages to improve the foundational concepts of their students, our grads can outperform others in the international industry. But we’re not doing that, and it is because our professors are not good, and even those who are good are dated. We need to align our content with something relevant, be it relevant to a critical theoretical problem or relevant to an industrial issue. Even if our professors slightly do a better job in data structures, algorithms, and not just teach linked lists in C for the sake of teaching them, our grads will be hiring ready. Just focus on the basic and foundational issues that can be solved through distributed systems or graph theory, our students will be instantly employable in the best parts of the world industry. My experience suggests that right out of the gate the situation isn’t great, but once inside the industry, our grads are a different person altogether after just one year in the industry.\nDo any of the ed-tech startups you’re involved in address this very gap? SkipQ is one such space which I have funded, advised and helped develop the curriculum for. They take fresh grads and train them for just 5-6 weeks and make them employable for the best software industry jobs of Pakistan. It’s not a preparation for job interview Q\u0026amp;A, the curriculum is a hands-on software development project, where their design and code keeps building through agile weekly demos and feedback development loops. They are a different person by the end of the 6 weeks because they now know a dozen or so AWS services and by connecting and integrating them they’ve solved a real world use-case, they’ve not just designed the problem, they know how to operationalize their code, they know how to open and manage the tickets in sprint, etc. They are spending 14 hours a day of hardcore coding, to get through the program. These are processes and skills which almost no software engineering and computing professors at universities can even spell for their students. The disconnect and gulf with the industry is ever widening. On the positive side, imagine if SkipQ can pull this off in 5-6 weeks, what can the university not do in 4 years’ time!\nIs there any structured forum available where good professors from the university can seek for industrial mentorship, just in order to improve their courses and students? The universities have lost so many gems to the industry over the past few years, people who felt they didn’t have the academic freedom to bring the impactful and needed change, and neither were getting respectable salaries at universities. But all of these people still care a lot about improving the standard of Pakistani graduates. And these mentors I’m talking about are not looking for money anymore. I don’t have any hope that any university is going to help build this network. ReCompute could perhaps build this network of mentors – all those great academicians who have left academia. Make it clear to the mentors what is required of them and connect them with the best teachers from the university and wonderful things can happen for sure, so that mentors’ time isn’t wasted. We would not be interested in disgruntled people who vent and whine, bring us great teachers who know they want to better control the controllables, and not hide behind policies etc. In Harry Potter, Dumbledore says to Hogwarts, “help will be available to those who ask for it” but then he corrects himself and says, “help will be available to those who deserve it.”\nAny parting thoughts for the university and also for the faculty members? Trying something is required, more of the same is not going to work. I don’t have an easy fix, neither for the universities of Pakistan, nor for the vast majority of faculty members. Number one realization should be not to waste the time and money of the kids that come to you. Without this realization the point is moot. If it was up to me, I would shut down 80% of Pakistani universities and give this space to polytechnic 1 year diploma institutions, so that at least 3 years of the majority of students would not be wasted. Our economy would be better served this way. This is not the situation with the rest of the world. Just because universities have really no incentive to improve, I am now pinning my hopes and energies to those private startups in ed-tech that aim to attack this serious societal gap, but since they are startups, they have a direct stake and incentive to improve their product and services. At least these startups are going to try doing things differently, but they are going to try and fail fast, and keep iterating till they succeed at something. University, on the other hand, is a failed experiment, which is ready to slide further down the failure path, in Pakistan.\nWhy is it that the universities or institutions in the West aren’t in such a miserable state? The problem boils down to quality at the selection stage. When I was doing my PhD in the US, the absolute top best grads/post-grads in the research labs would go on to join academia, knowing fully well that they’ll be earning less pay than their industry peers, but they’ll join academia for the associated prestige and freedom. They would do some organizational politics too but they are there because they believe in some mission. While in Pakistan, in most of the cases people who can’t find jobs in the industry keep studying beyond undergrad for MS and then PhD and then join the academia. That’s a self-defeating bar. The ripple effect is devastating. I’ve seen in industry too, the competent A players will continuously grow their teams by inducting more A and A+ players, while the B players will always feel threatened by a better player so they’ll hire C and C-. The bad DNA in the organization has a perverse ripple effect, it’s not just that they suck, they hire more suckier people after them, and if by mistake a better player gets through, the band of bad players will make sure that they make his or her life miserable.\nSo, the 80% universities who are full of such incompetent B and C players should be barred from wasting 4 years of students’ lives, so I want to short-circuit that from happening, and take every A and A+ player from these bad universities and concentrate them in the remainder of 20% universities, so that these faculty members will create graduates with sound foundations, and will be teaching industry relevant courses, and will be doing IEEE Transactions every time. These A players will further make sure that they’ll induct more A+ players. Make sure that these faculty members are taken care of. Even no industry should be able to poach them by matching their salaries. Give these universities the funds being wasted at the other 80% universities. All those students who are looking for such depth, they should aim for admissions to these universities, otherwise step into a diploma and learn the rest of skills in the industry.\nIf there’s anything unsaid, you could still use this space before we sign off I’m building a startup and working on ground-breaking technology in the cloud space - Kubernetes. I’m hiring talent for it. Anyone around the world, listening in, and qualifies, please ping me!\n","date":1670716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670716800,"objectID":"a6ac9001437f4063461a024ed40bdf93","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast08-ali-khayyam/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/podcast08-ali-khayyam/","section":"post","summary":"Dr. Ali Khayam, a stellar teacher and world-class scholar, with high impact factor publications, grants, awards, and recognition any academician in the world could dream of, still left academia stating that his work wasn’t creating impact in a university.","tags":null,"title":"ReCompute with Ali Khayam | Why academia is broken | Creating real impact | EdTech’s Promise | Podcast # 8","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"This is one of the most special ReCompute episodes as today we have as our guests, students – the ultimate creation of this whole enterprise that we call universities. We are lucky to have a diverse panel, in the shape of Aiman who has already graduated from Habib University; Musawar, who is the final year student at Namal University, Mianwali, and Farae who is now in the second year of his undergrad at Giki. We often come across a slice of perspective from faculty members or Deans or HEC or accreditors, but rarely does the student perspective find its way to the higher academia podiums. Today at ReCompute, it does.\n  Why did you or your parents choose your university? Can you walk us through some of the choices students make while shortlisting a university? Farae: Because my mother is a computer scientist, and father an electrical engineer from UET, so they helped me shortlist the universities which have sound education programs. GIKI, NUST, LUMS, UET and a couple more made it to that list. As I wanted to do computer engineering, and not just computer science, GIKI eventually came out on top, as they have a well-defined computer engineering program unlike other universities. I also wanted a university which is not only recognized internationally but also accredited by PEC. GIKI seemed to tick all the right checkboxes for me.\nAiman: Unlike Farae, I never studied programming before undergrad, or wasn’t very well-informed about accreditation etc, but I was a pre-engineering student and liked maths and sciences. NUST was an obvious choice, but Habib, a new venture coincidentally popped up a few kilometers from my home in Karachi at the right time for me. Because of the proximity, I had a chance to visit their campus, and interact with their faculty before taking the admission there. I really liked what they were building there, and getting a scholarship from Habib eventually was the last deciding factor for me.\nMusawar: Namal wasn’t in the initial options of mine. My choices were FAST, NUST, Comsats Islamabad, PIEAS etc. I didn’t have great mentors at home like Farae, so I had to do all the research on my own, but someone had pointed me towards HEC rankings, so I did take a look at them. What was more important for me was the fee structure of the universities, as affordability was an issue for me and my family. Eventually, I only ended up getting a scholarship from Namal, but the final decision factor was the good reviews I got about Namal’s CS faculty and environment from Namal alumni.\nBefore the admissions, did you take a look at the faculty? If yes, what did you look for in them or their profiles? Aiman: I was from the intermediate background, so most of my teachers had been very stern and serious, but when I interacted with Habib’s teachers, they were all so welcoming and polite, so that was important for me. Secondly, for much of the Pakistani mentality, at least at the intermediate stage, for the faculty members to have a foreign degree matters. Not so much, in hindsight.\nFarae: I didn’t really investigate this aspect after looking at the fact that the majority of the faculty members were foreign qualified.\nSo, the previous questions were about your view about the faculty or university before you joined, but after the fact, what is your more informed internal view now. What are the best teachers doing right? Musawar: Besides scholarship and curriculum, the most important aspect for a university is the quality of teaching. My only message to higher-ups would be to never compromise on that, by not hiring those who don’t know how to teach.\nAiman: In hindsight, now I can say that it doesn’t matter at all if the teacher has an international degree. What really matters is that the teacher has empathy, is a mentor, doesn’t disrespect the learner, and stays connected and concerned for their students’ future even beyond graduation.\nFarae: Beside the academic advising, what also matters is advice on social and personal issues. The teachers who also focus on the ‘why’ questions before stepping into the direct instruction is also very important.\nCan you tell us about some very specific characteristics of the teacher that taught you the best course at university? Farae: My intro to programming and object-oriented programming teacher was amazing. What I really loved was that instead of coding on the board, he would connect his IDE to the projector and live-code in front of us. That really made the difference. He also focused on applications, so we made 2D video games and when we saw the connection between what we have always loved (games) and what we were learning (programming) it made everything more meaningful. In another course on Discrete Structures, what I really loved was the passion of the instructor for his course and that did manage to infect us a little bit too, even though Discrete is a relatively dry subject.\nAiman: One of my best programming teachers practices engaging the whole class throughout the course, instead of focusing more on just the studious students. As a student when I recognize that the teacher recognizes my existence and asks me questions in the classes, then it becomes my personal responsibility to give my extra throughout the course. The focus of the course becomes learning, instead of just covering the contents promised in the course outline.\nMusawar: There have been many good teachers who know how to teach their content, but the greatest teachers have only been the ones who have managed to excite me and students about their own subject.\nFrom the students’ perspective how important is the factor of course load? Can a good teacher turn into bad just because he or she hands in more work? Or conversely, can a bad teacher appear good just because he or she creates a light-weight course? Aiman: First of all, this is a bit subjective, an assignment can appear to be a one-day work for one and the same assignment can appear to be week-long to another. Secondly, it isn’t necessary that a teacher who turns towards edutainment (showing movies etc during class timings) becomes the favorite for all students. Students also need to balance out the courses per semester based on prior information about the course load.\nFarae: At engineering universities usually the course load is significant, and sometimes it is so much that students are pushed towards taking the shortcuts. If there was a mechanism for balancing out the course loads across courses and spreading it evenly throughout the semester, it will help the students stay more focused on learning.\nMusawar: I don’t think that the students are stupid that they’ll fall for those teachers who give easy assignments and grades. The course evaluations at the end of the course are anonymous, so the students give the feedback judiciously.\nFrom a students’ perspective, what should a teacher never really do? Students: Comparison between their students should be a big no-go area. Teachers shouldn’t give preferential treatment to a subset of their students. Teachers should learn how to grade fairly, and never threaten their students based on grades or attendance etc. Especially the new PhDs should invest their time and energy on how to teach first, instead of taking university teaching for granted, even the primary school teachers are required to know how to teach. Lastly, trading off conceptual learning with course coverage should be a big no.\nIf we were to zoom out now, and go from the course or instructor level to that of the curriculum level, what did your curriculum (or extra-curriculum) had to offer outside of computing, what did the non-CS courses help achieve, especially since all universities will lay claims over producing great well-rounded computer science graduates? Aiman: Besides the general grooming that liberal arts courses offer, just being able to strike a conversation with anyone, teamwork, being able to appreciate the other are some of the aspects that are necessary in order to qualify as a member of human civilization. The extra-curricular is equally important, I believe it prepares us for the industry, fills the gap between academia and industry, preparing for coding competitions etc. is a qualitatively different learning skill from that which we get to experience in the courses of programming and OOP, however good they may be. On the flip side, the problem-solving aspect needed more emphasis in our curriculum. For instance, we learnt advanced and complex dynamic programming in data structures and algorithms, but in the job interviews they give us applied scenarios. That application I got to learn through hacker-rank or coding competitions.\nMusawar: I have been part of the Literary Society as well as Namal’s Student Council. What this has done for me is to improve my communication skills verbally as well as while professionally writing emails. It has also geared me for event and problem management. These are going to be vital life-long skills beyond the walls of university.\nFarae: We are an engineering dominant university, and I’m just at the start of my program, but I believe there is one non-engineering course per semester, either from English or management side, which helps us engineers groom our communication and management side. I think those courses are equally important.\nCan you say something about the university experience now, expectations vs. reality? Aiman: For me the expectations were a dual of party, independence and degree, job, but now after having gone through the whole charade, what really becomes the ultimate experience is the people one engages with, both students as well as the faculty. Another important aspect of a university is the self-exploration in a safe space.\nMusawar: What I loved experiencing at Namal was the diversity of students coming from all parts of Pakistan. On the flip side, our universities need to take student experiences more seriously, and also incorporate students’ views and voices especially in those decisions which are going to affect students directly.\nFarae: Ultimately, it is the students and faculty who best know what’s best for academics, but the administration often makes decisions which are sub-optimal, as there’s a communication gap between students, faculty, and the administration.\nWhat’s one thing that universities can improve? Aiman: Don’t have GPA as the only criterion for every opportunity and decision making, for instance if there’s an entrepreneurship related student exchange program, having a cut on GPA is not the best choice.\nMusawar: There’s student exchange as well as internship related information being relayed to students, but there’s hardly any mentorship that guides us every step along the way. Last, but not the least, universities should never compromise on teaching quality, and those faculty members who are best at teaching should be retained at all costs.\nAny last word? Students: We’ve said so much about the teachers and administrations, but teaching and learning is a two-way street, and we, the students, need to meet the efforts of our teachers and institutions halfway and realize our own share of responsibility, in order to improve the standard of education in Pakistan.\n","date":1662681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662681600,"objectID":"00b7b0b030242325bce81bbd3fd9a5fc","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast07-students/","publishdate":"2022-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/podcast07-students/","section":"post","summary":"This is one of the most special ReCompute episodes as today we have as our guests, students – the ultimate creation of this whole enterprise that we call universities.

We ask them why they felt universities in Pakistan are not producing the quality of graduates they could, and why conventional teaching approach in most Pakistani Universities was probably not fulfilling its purpose. We then explore their teaching methodology in some detail, getting down to the level of specifics about teaching in a CS classroom that we have never been to before in our podcasts. We hope both CS teachers and students benefit from listening to our guests.\n  Generally, the industry’s standpoint is that computer science programs in Pakistan aren’t producing the kind of graduates that it requires. Is that our fundamental problem? Umar Suleman (US) The problem is real. There are about 10,000 new jobs in the software industry per annum, and there are about 20,000 graduates being produced, but at max about 1000 of them are employable. This is a deficit, but also simultaneously, a great opportunity for us, the educators.\nAre most of these 1000 employable graduates concentrated in a handful of universities or spread around uniformly? If concentrated, then what could be the reason for that? US They are concentrated, and the reason is that in those universities the traditional education or educationist-first principle is relatively still intact. Ideally, if you want to address the education crisis in Pakistan, one recipe is that the teachers in private universities should be given at least a semblance of respect that the owners of the universities currently have. For instance, when the owner solves a problem by bending or breaking the stated rules, the way he is praised for thinking outside the box, if the same attitude is meted to teachers, then it would be a teacher’s or education-first institute. The over-emphasis on research, at the cost of teaching is also a sign that institutional priority isn’t education-first.\nShould there be some universities that should focus more on research and some on teaching? US For me, this is a premature question to ask at this stage, in terms of our cultural progression. First comes a new body of knowledge always, for instance once upon a time it was the fundamental knowledge around metallurgy, then comes the scale of skillful individuals within the culture that gives birth to genuine money-making industries, and once those genuine industries start facing genuine issues, however small their problems might be, the culture needs to have its best brains ready for this stage’s problem solving. This does not mean that this is a strictly linear model and that there are no exceptions to it. At the more mature stage of growth, the civilization needs to have pure research-based universities, but before that happens, the best brains of a culture ought to be given a respectful, dignified home within the current universities.\nLet’s take Sarfraz onboard as well, before we head towards potential solutions, as to what he thinks is the fundamental problem. Sarfraz Raza (SR) To me, much more than the need to ensure dignity for teachers, is the need to ensure dignity for our students. To make up for their incompetence, some teachers degrade their students and their questions in strange ways. Of course, students are lagging, but since the teachers are in power, that’s why in my view they are a bigger problem, with the smallness of their priorities and university politics.\nSince it appears that what Umar Suleman was saying was absolutely true (teachers-first), and yet what you are saying is also absolutely true (teachers ought to put their house in order first), how do you reconcile between the positions? SR I’m hopeless to a large extent as far as the faculty environment in university goes, but I’m still very hopeful as far as our students are concerned. For instance, during Covid, in my online course offering, when the students started going quiet on me and stopped interacting, after my persistent enquiry from them, they finally opened up with me. I came to know that most of the teachers are not even using the whiteboard technology or even the tabs that the university provided to them. Instead of adapting and learning something new, teachers are pushing everything onto slides. Students are getting depressed while they are rightfully finding it impossible to concentrate on the boring content and pedagogy. Teachers are not checking the assignments on time; hence the students are clueless about their learning progress. This makes the students tune out even in good classes. But perhaps the teachers have also tuned out because their universities have started expecting an unrealistic quantity of research and services from them besides teaching.\nUmar, I hope this doesn’t turn into a chicken and egg problem, as to what comes first. US It isn’t. Principles don’t follow a linear progression stepwise; principles are timeless in that sense. And it is a principle that a teacher ought to be given respect and honor, and the decision-makers in universities need to adhere to this principle. But connecting it to Sarfraz’ point, it seems that the teacher also ought to remain cognizant of the fact that he or she is to have the deepest respect in the whole society, and he or she better act likewise, to ensure that that remains the case. Teaching is a special designation that demands respect, much more than other cadres of the society, and it’s also important to know why there’s respect for this designation – it is not because of research, it’s not even because of knowledge. It is because of the long-term and defining service to the community through changing the minds and futures of students. Such a teacher, who recognizes this role, would treat students accordingly. Amongst my own teachers I still deeply respect those few who were selfless and more concerned about their students.\nWonderfully put. Can we shift to how you have set up your programming fundamentals course? What are its fundamental ingredients? US My experience has forced me to the conclusion that if a student has good foundation in just 3 courses from the first 3 semesters, programming fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and data structures/algorithms, then it’s almost impossible for the student to have a bad industry career, and on the flip side if a student has had bad foundations in these 3 courses, then it’s almost impossible to have a great industry career. As soon as this was evident to me, I forgo my graduate level and elective level courses and by choice opted to teach these foundational courses within my university – at the cost of publishing through grad students. In my view, the ideal teachers for these foundational courses should be expert programmers themselves, who are bigger than even the best programming books out there. Pedagogy wise, the course should be problem-based rather than topic-based, i.e. it should be done through posing the problem in front of the students, and collectively solving the problems within the class, and only then embedding the teaching of programming constructs within these solution designs. For example, selling the students the idea of putting a frame around a 2D face image, instead of teaching them abstractly about 2D arrays or loops. Thirdly, to develop a habit, the course is centered around problem solving both within the class and associated assignments outside the shared lecture hours, resulting in 20 + assignments in a single course. But the most important ingredient for me is the development of a faculty of comprehension within the students, i.e., they must imagine the computational abstractions and connections between them within their heads before coding, just based on their teacher’s verbal narratives. This is done through a dialogical process. For the development of this fundamental faculty, it is imperative that the students aren’t shown too many visualizations up front. I show them actual snippets of code only eventually and to only cement the psychological impressions in the students’ head that their teacher is at the top of his programming game. Once this faculty of comprehension is strengthened (and it is often a painful process,) it goes a long way, up to their final year project and later in industry.\nSR In one aspect, my emphasis is absolutely the same as Umar Suleman’s. My course is also entirely problem based, I don’t teach loop etc. But where I disagree is that my course is entirely through live coding in front of students in an IDE. It is because of my own bad first encounter with programming when I was a fresh undergrad student. Pseudocode and flowcharts never worked for me. I usually start my course with MIT’s visual programming language called Scratch, hence the students learn programming through the instant visual effect of their code blocks on a visual object. The best programmers are eventually those who, over time, have developed the same muscle or faculty that Umar Suleman mentioned – they can predict more correctly and more often the effect of their code before hitting the Run button. Just like Umar I also believe that I have to inspire my students in every class, but my translation of that term is that my students should look at their teacher as a super problem solver and a super programmer, one they would like to emulate. For that, they have to witness, in every class, their teacher solving problems and programming in front of them, as much as possible. This includes, at times, writing wrong code and getting stuck and then maneuvering collectively out of the issue programmatically. This includes learning and teaching the art of debugging using a debugger, and this can’t be achieved by teaching only through pen and paper. All information regarding my course is publicly accessible online for anyone’s viewing, which also shows how we shift from Scratch to C++, and the kind of problems we solve every week, and the online teaching resources I employ, and how we move from small building blocks to bigger problem breakdown. The whole point is that just like a small kid cannot learn the human language if the adults aren’t talking in the kid’s presence, similarly, when it comes to learning a programming language, it will have to be a similar kind of immersive experience, where the kids are witnessing their elder(s) use the programming language every day.\nDr. Umar, we can readily appreciate when you said that working the computational problem-solving muscle in your students’ mind comes before actual coding, hence the choice of paper and pen makes sense, but what Sarfraz said about programming language being an immersive experience also makes total sense, hence the choice of live coding and debugging inside the classroom. How do you reconcile the two? US Debugging isn’t about placing a breakpoint. They’ll be placing the breakpoint at all the wrong places if they don’t have the complete detailed picture of their program and its logic in their mind first. Debugging is again, in the head first, and if the student has learnt how to use his or her own mind as a computer, and that is precisely what is the faculty that I want to build in my students, then they’ll be able to sniff or trace either through a breakpoint or some other means, as to the origin of the bug. I demonize the error in my class, as it’s a sign that the students have written the code without solving the problem first.\nSR I completely agree that even debugging has to take place in the mind first, but I would like to emphasize that for very large programs, or distributed applications, it’s imperative to have good hands-on debugging skills.\nAny parting thoughts? SR I’ve recently started using leetcode, where the students can submit their code as solutions to my chosen problem instances and at its backend the leetcode service runs tons of unit test cases on the code submission, and let’s them know which test cases have failed. It also tells them the overall global rank of their submission. It’s important because our students only test their codes very weakly.\nUS In my opinion, there is a psychological tendency when you, as a teacher, throw too many online resources at your students, that you can discharge yourself from the responsibility of guarding your students’ future well-being as a programmer, i.e., if they don’t become a great resource for the industry you could say that it’s not your fault, because you had given them a whole world of resources. So, my parting thought is once again that the teacher should be at the center of everything that happens in the course. In our tradition, a teacher is a person who takes the pain – the pain of taking his students’ responsibility, not just in one course, but forever. In my living experience, the most impact-creating teachers have only been those who have never let anything else in their lives muddle this perspective. For if this perspective is intact, then everything that Sarfraz and I do in our class will matter to students, otherwise a teacher can add a whole lot of methodologies or tools to make the course interesting, it will not have the same impact on their students or their lives!\n","date":1654992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654992000,"objectID":"b0f48937194c8d755071cf1303ad06e0","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast06-umar-sarfraz/","publishdate":"2022-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/podcast06-umar-sarfraz/","section":"post","summary":"Both our guests in this podcast are Computer Science (CS) university teachers, and both have their own, unique, unconventional approach to teaching introductory programming courses.

He came back to Pakistan intending to retire, but in 2001 General Musharraf formulated a task force which was to work at devising a vision for improving the higher education in Pakistan. It was co-chaired by Syed Babar Ali and Dr. Zulfiqar was a member of that task force as well as the chair of the sub-committee on vision and governance of universities. The conception of HEC came from that task force. One of the recommendations of the task force was that there should be an integrated 4-year undergraduate program in Pakistan. This podcast of Recompute wants to explore the history, process and current status of the “revamping of undergraduate curriculum 2020” project.\n  Where did the curricular revamping idea emerge from? I was Vice-Chancellor of Peshawar University from 2000-2004 where I had started working on building the required integrated undergraduate curriculum, and in the meantime HEC had been officially formed in 2002. As soon as HEC sent out the notification to all universities to restructure their undergrad programs, what almost every university in Pakistan did was to combine their two-year BA and two year MA degrees into one 4 year semester-based program. I refused to do that as VC of Peshawar University, because in the initial HEC task force we really believed that the whole curriculum framework needs to be restructured so that it can meet certain objectives.\nWhat was really amiss in the on-going programs and curriculum that the need for restructuring was felt so strongly by you? I’ll be very practical. Barring a few students, our undergraduates were getting out with degrees for sure but none of them had acquired any worthwhile skills or competencies required of them along the way. Since I had taught in the US as well as in England, I saw the quality of undergraduates there. For a vast majority of first-world undergraduates, they don’t need to study any further, undergrad is their last degree. Whereas, in Pakistan, the piece of paper students get at the end of 16 years of education is almost valueless when they go into the market hunting for jobs. On the other hand, the capacity or potential that I saw even in Peshawar University students was at par with their counterpart students across the world. This was the same basic issue at hand that became the starting point for a need for restructuring the undergraduate curriculum at the time when HEC was formulated.\nBut more recently, when Tariq Banuri became the chairman HEC, he asked me what I wanted to do, and I knew exactly that we needed to revamp the core backbone of higher education – the undergraduate program. At the moment this backbone is very weak, as it gives not very useful employees to the industry, and feeds weak future-teachers to Masters, MPhil and PhD programs, creating a vicious cycle. Anyway, after rejoining HEC I asked around about the undergraduate policy in place. This was around Jan 2019, and I received a 2-pager document. It was basically a 2 year + 2 year formula, with some patch-on courses labeled as General Education courses. And they were not General Education courses at all. I tried, in vain, to get hold of any minutes of the meetings or the process through which this 2-pager policy was arrived at – I couldn’t get hold of a single such document. Thereon, I initiated a long and tedious process of meetings and consultations with important stakeholders of academia, including faculty, registrars, VCs etc. and it was heartening to know that they unanimously agreed that the current undergraduate curriculum isn’t producing the kind of successful, useful, educated individuals that the world needs – someone with technical competencies and who can have a conversation about important things in life, and who has a sense of what is going on in the world. An engineer needs to really know what the philosophers and historians have been saying, and the medical students should also be mathematically cultured. So, this is what drove us to revamp the old status-quo of single-subject focused narrow system. Now we have documentation from all of those consultation and dialogue meetings which gave birth to the revamped undergrad policy.\nBut what happened between the inception of the integrated curriculum idea around 2001 and 2019. How was the status-quo of the 2+2 formula set in place? HEC just put this 2+2 template without providing any training or technical resources for how to do assessments in a semester system, for example. Secondly, and much more horribly, what was actually instituted was the creation of special allowances - all research focused: if you have a PhD you get x amount of allowance, if you publish a paper, y amount, if you supervise a PhD, z allowance etc. What this institutionalization did was to take the meaning out of what is called research, as the motivational structure got reduced to this single measurable KPI for hiring and promotion etc. This not only gave birth to plagiarism and fake journals, but more importantly, it pushed the faculty to ignore teaching, as they were being rewarded only for their research output. I have overwhelming anecdotal evidence from all my HEC consultations where almost everyone said that after the officiating of HEC, the quality of undergraduate education in Pakistan has gotten worse, as all the focus got shifted to graduate and postgraduate level. All of this confusion was a consequence of misplaced priorities, which translated to faculty policies.\nBut if the quality of undergraduate education in Pakistan has deteriorated because of lopsided faculty policies or the lack of teachers’ training, then why blame it all on the poor curriculum, and why only change the curricular structure? I’ll candidly confess that we could have begun from a lot of starting points, but we began from revamping the curriculum framework, because frankly speaking, I was the one doing it. Had it been someone else, they could have started with designing teachers’ training, or another individual could have started with university and faculty regulations and policies. I do believe that starting from curriculum is a good choice, as one has to begin from somewhere, and also because the rest of the things can be aligned with the spirit of this curricular change. I’m an optimistic person.\nIt’s a pleasant surprise that you did not find any resistance from university stakeholders or faculty! I don’t even blame our university faculty members who do not understand this kind of balanced undergrad, as they received a specialized subject-focused undergrad when they were students, while the best parts of the developed world had taught a holistic, balanced set of courses to their undergrad students. After receiving a specialized undergrad, most of our current faculty members went outside Pakistan for Masters and PhDs, which in any case, are specialized programs. So, it is no surprise that the kind of undergraduate program we have designed has not been experienced by most of our faculty. But in our defense, we are not reinventing the wheel at all. What works wonderfully for the better parts of the world, we are only helping create the same experience for our dear undergraduate students, so they can also become useful, conscientious citizens of the modern world.\nCan you elaborate upon some of the salient features of this new revamped undergrad policy? Foremost shift from the subject-focused previous era is that this is a student-centered policy. By that I mean that a student should be able to take admission in a university and only later on decide about the program or major based on an informed decision, as undergrad is a perfect stage in one’s life for self-exploration. Student-centered also means that we are investing in students’ long-term success, and for qualifying as a thoughtful and useful member of the modern civilization we are making the students go through a series of courses in the first couple of years. These general education courses actually promise the breadth that is the hallmark of an undergraduate education worldwide: courses from humanities such as philosophy, history, creative arts; courses from social sciences such as psychology, sociology, economics, political science; courses from natural sciences such as geology, ecology; courses that teach quantitative reasoning in today’s data-intensive world; there are also courses focused on language and writing skills; finally civilizational studies that teach about the origins of Islam as well as origins of Pakistan. Thirdly, the revamped policy especially asks the universities to teach practical and professional skills to students formally, by taking student societies and internships more seriously. These are some of the fundamental pillars on which the holistic framework stands. Understanding each pillar’s significance and their inter-relatedness is the key for moving forward. I know there are logistical issues around admissions and accreditation bodies, but while we have already devised creative alternatives for some of the logistical issues, compromising on the spirit of the holistic framework is a no-go.\nStaying true to the letter and spirit of the new policy, are there any creative workarounds for very large and very old establishments, especially the large public universities? We’re already thinking of relaxing the policy for admissions to university; for instance, an engineering related student can be admitted to a specific school, but there should be proper transfer mechanisms in place if the student later wants to transfer to any other program, school wide or university wide, given that the student has done well in related General education courses, in 12th grade, and in related admission test components. Secondly, instead of pushing all the 12-13 general education courses in the first 2 or so semesters, we are okay if some of the courses are spread across the 4 years, creating more room for subject-specific courses early on as well. Lastly, even though we have defined the spirit of each general education course, and also rolled out their model course outlines, but staying true to the definitions of sub-categories, spirit of the policy and also to the two guiding principles of the policy – freedom of expression and academic honesty – any university can create their own set of general education courses. One public university, NUST, and some of the good private universities like LUMS at Lahore, Habib at Karachi and Namal at Mianwali were already working along similar curricular directions before we launched this revamping of undergraduate education policy. But bear in mind, HEC has the mandate to improve the higher education quality across the entire country. I wish other universities also creatively embrace the change keeping in view the long-term success of their students.\nSpeaking of creativity, perhaps another way to inculcate the historical lens within students could have been to design every course, even the technical ones, such that it touches historical perspective within its content, instead of teaching just one course on history separately. Is that too ideal for HEC? For reasons I don’t want to go into, most of our faculty has lost the ability of designing and developing proper syllabi. Most of our faculty takes one textbook, and chapter by chapter copying or mapping of the textbook becomes the course.\nIf this is the unfortunate state of affairs of the majority that is going to deliver this new revamped undergraduate curriculum, how have you ensured that the same history is not going to repeat itself? With the previous 2+2 formula, and despite almost all universities fulfilling ranking bodies’ checklists (number of PhDs, departments, course offerings, research papers etc), they were obviously failing to produce quality students. How will the situation of treating this new revamped set of ideals as just another HEC imposed checklist change? I’ll give you a few examples of what HEC is doing differently this time around. The World Bank has approached us and with their support, the idea to develop learning objectives based milestones, year-wise, to go hand in hand with the revamped curriculum is underway. Secondly, with Tariq Banuri at the helm of affairs, I have one person who completely understands this project, and wants to see it succeed. He formed the Post-secondary Education Reform Unit, which I’m heading. So, in parallel to designing the curriculum, we are designing capacity building activities for faculty, focused on pedagogy. We’re tying this up with the World Bank agreement. Another very important capacity building exercise is focused on policy implementation. These supplementary exercises need to be carried out in a systematic manner, going forward. But having said this, I still believe that the younger lot of faculty members within our universities, once given this fresh curricular perspective, will channel their positive creative forces in the right direction, to effect a positive change.\nJust like HEC is thinking of capacity building regarding curriculum policy implementation, don’t you think that HEC also needs to revamp the faculty policies in order to make the revamped curriculum a success, as the lopsided selection, appraisal and promotion policies have taken the emphasis within universities away from teaching a solid undergraduate program, and faculty members are forced by these lopsided policies to give more time to their Masters and PhD students, in order to prove their research-worthiness? I respect Dr. Tariq Banuri a lot, as he’s a man of integrity and a true intellectual, and with him at the helm of affairs we have already been talking about these issues, and thinking of a 40-40-20 framework, which is an international norm. The policies, departments and faculty members give 40 percent weight to teaching as well as their research scholarship and 20 percent to their university services. Right now, there is no policy, almost everyone is counting the number of publications. In an ideal world, every faculty should be able to have his/her own contract based on different weightages assigned to teaching, research and services, but since I have also served as a bureaucrat in my past, I do know the importance of bureaucracy in any organization, but I also know that wherever the bureaucratic efficacy takes precedence over the purpose and mission of the organization things start deteriorating, which is what has happened to Pakistani universities, as well as HEC. In this regard, HEC, again in collaboration with the World Bank, is going to revamp the Quality Enhancement Cells (QEC) within universities, as they have only become quantity and administration-focused, interventionist and monitoring cells, which isn’t really helping the cause of education. It seems that everyone has lost sight of the fact that in a university, the most important stakeholder is the student, then the faculty, then the administration and VCs, and HEC and accreditors are at the very bottom – not the other way around. We are developing the right set of ToRs to reset QECs’ direction within universities. With these supplementary revamps, it is hoped that the curricular revamp will be effective.\nI would also like to highlight again that in addition to curricular changes, the implementation of the new policy requires universities to establish three new offices: office of academic advisement for students, office of internship and placement, and office of extra-curricular activities. HEC has already allocated and rolled out a budget to 16 universities for the establishment of these offices within their campuses. I know that the best private universities in Pakistan have been those who already have had their focus on these 3 areas before HEC asked them to revamp. For the rest of Pakistan, we have asked the universities to get their houses in order till Fall of 2022.\nWe believe our dialogue today has converged wonderfully to the conclusion that HEC could have initiated the process of change from any one of a number of aspects, but curriculum seems to be just the right choice. With this, and with the supplementary capacity building exercises in the pipeline, it is hoped that universities will take further required steps in the right direction and align their QECs and faculty policies to the effect of making this curricular change a success for themselves and their students!

This was intriguing, as historically, most of the student-led strikes were for non-academic issues at that time. Khalid begins ReComputing by shedding more light on that event:\n  In most universities, the blue-eyed faculty members get to teach their chosen courses, while at the time of the course allocation, the rest of the courses are distributed whimsically by their HoDs. So when that happens, and if the teacher does not have the will or competency to make additional effort to learn a new subject, he’ll dance, i.e. he’ll pass time while making sure that the students are happy. Sometimes this dance even includes revealing the final exam prior to the day of exam. Surely, this dance makes most of the students happy most of the time, but it didn’t work for Khalid Latif; and after he talked to other studious class-fellows they all agreed that they deserve better than this, and that this isn’t even an evaluation. As soon as they got the paper (same as revealed by the teacher earlier) they returned the empty answer sheets and were almost proud of the creative and silent way of their protest, but were shocked to know that the university administration did propaganda against the students at first, and when that failed, they failed to take any action against the way the course and exam had been conducted. Nevertheless, Khalid Latif and the batch got the message across to the other side successfully, which at least got them thinking for a while.\nUsually the ‘theetas’ (marks maximizers) in universities are the last people to show any semblance of activism. On the other hand, they are often seen ditching positive causes at the last moments. What made you take an unconventional route? I was never a ‘theeta.’ I was just in love with computer science, even though my father and all his contacts “advised” me how there is going to be no life if I don’t study chemistry or do pre-engineering. However, I just spent my days programming in BASIC language and getting fascinated by it. I only started taking marks seriously when I realized that I need good marks in FSc in order to get admission in computer science programs. In short, I never associated myself with the top GPA band, I was driven by my love for computing instead. In contrast, today’s university students are also protesting their exams, but sadly for very wrong reasons – perhaps because students aren’t doing computer science out of their passion, but rather because they were forced to make that choice by their elders. Speaking of unconventional routes, we were also part of an underground movement, where a bunch of our senior alumni who were doing great jobs in Lahore’s software houses were coaching the juniors for developing great final year projects. These sessions took place all night long and were so helpful in creating the software engineers that our university couldn’t, even out of those students who were less passionate about cs, perhaps because of senior-junior relationship. I wish that circle could have kept going after us.\nYou were all geared up for a great career in industry, and you did join it initially, but then suddenly, we heard the news of you joining academia. Can you tell us what made you interested in a university life? Frankly, I wasn’t interested! My mother kept pushing me to come back from Lahore to Bahawalpur, and there was this opening at a university at Bahawalpur. I finally gave in even though my interest wasn’t in teaching but in programming. However, I soon realized that I could produce students who’d be great at programming. And the day I got to know that one of my students landed a job with double the salary as mine, I really fell in love with my profession. Some years later, I also went for PhD to Austria.\nWhat’s different in Austrian universities, when compared with Pakistani universities? In every university across the world, there’s always people fighting for resources, be it financial or human or compute resources. But while in Austria I saw the fight taking place positively, in Pakistan, the fight is negative. The reason is that in Austria, faculty members were striving for excellence in an area of their domain, and in Pakistan people want the resources to highlight themselves and to get themselves promoted. In Austria, faculty members aren’t too focused on becoming a full professor asap, but they want to be known as an expert in their area. That’s why you’ll find many wonderful faculty members in European universities who aren’t full professors, but in Pakistan you’ll find many full professors who haven’t attained their academic potential, but they have managed to attain the positions. I’ve known and met a 50 years old lecturer from New Zealand who is amazing as well as satisfied with what he’s contributing. One way out of this negative politics is to stop having a fixed quota for the number of associate and full professor seats a department can have, so that people stop gravitating around power and concentrate on their own academic interests. We tried bringing this to SEECS. Second marked difference was that in Austria there were clearly distinct teaching and research career tracks for faculty members, and both kinds of personalities were cherished within the system. There were associate and full professors who weren’t bringing in any funding but were teaching more than 2 courses a semester, and did an excellent job at that. In Pakistan, there’s a single formula for promotion and since the number of publications has taken over as a metric, faculty members have started to neglect teaching. One solution is to have separate career progression tracks for teaching as well as research, to create a dignified and enabling environment within the university. We placed 3 separate criteria for faculty profiles at NUST: a research, a teaching and a hybrid model, and faculty members chose their own tracks. We were lucky that like-minded faculty members got together at SEECS and we were allowed to bring in new ideas by our administration. HEC could still play a positive role to promote a more enabling environment within universities, but unfortunately, they’ve reduced everything to the number of publications. Instead, if HEC starts ranking or funding universities according to the employability of their students, it would be a much more fruitful design, just like it is a requirement in getting Abbot’s accreditation.\nHow important is the role of the administrative support or is the comradeship of like-minded faculty members sufficient? The financial, moral, and other forms of support from administration is a pre-requisite for an enabling environment, but a prerequisite to that is the will in the faculty members to think in terms of a bigger picture, one that transcends their personal profiles and appraisals. Also, the faculty members should sometimes put themselves in the administration’s shoes and be creative enough to sustain alternatives.\nGiven all the like-minded support from faculty as well as administration, why did you leave academia and went back to industry? Back in 2011 when I was at NUST, I had a chance to collaborate with an international startup, Biome Analytics, who were interested in improving clinical decision making inside hospitals. This kind of applied research, that actually improved the lives of kidney patients, instead of just writing academic papers, reminded me of why I always wanted to be in computing – to be able to make useful value addition systems, for people. Eventually, I left academia and joined them full time. I do the kind of research in data science and machine learning that I love, and it gives me immense satisfaction that our decision support systems are actually being used within hospitals.\nWhat is industry looking for in university graduates? I know for a fact from my network that there’s a mammoth demand for quality computing graduates - those who have problem solving skills. Even if a candidate knows only C++ and zero Python, we can give him even 2-3 months for bridging that or any other technical gap, given that he has an appetite for analyzing and understanding problems and can trace the root of an issue that needs fixing, and lastly can design a potential solution to fix the root causes. Our organization has many novice programmers but who are excellent in solving and tracing computational problems whenever encountered. It seems that the universities aren’t instilling this skill set in their students, unfortunately, so the industry has to invest in training to make up for it. There was a time when FAST-Lahore was known in Pakistan as the number 1 computer science institution from employers’ perspective, and that was because in almost all courses in their stream they rigorously kept throwing problems from various angles towards their students, so the students, by the end of their degree were well exposed and experienced in problem solving; even their maths courses had programming rigor. Pedagogically, the teachers shouldn’t only throw an algorithm at students, but also let them grasp where this algorithm is going to be applied as a solution to a problem. This might slow down the course, or cover less content eventually, but if any university applies this principle consistently in all their courses, their graduates will be highly sought after in the industry. I know companies who are looking to even hire whole batches if the students have such problem-solving skills.\n","date":1644105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644105600,"objectID":"3f8682cd51ad49e5bc72d9714e8b5f96","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast04-khalid-latif/","publishdate":"2022-02-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/podcast04-khalid-latif/","section":"post","summary":"Noman came across Khalid Latif as his senior in his university at Bahawalpur where Khalid had kickstarted a final exam boycott movement.

We went through a reflective cross section of his life, first when he was a student, then his phase as a young scholar or a faculty member joining a university in Pakistan, and finally his experience as a dean of an important STEM school at LUMS. We sincerely think that any faculty member who wants to do anything creative and meaningful in his or her teaching, no doubt, must bring that element in the classroom in front of the students, but has also to creatively deal with departmental constraints and the wider university culture and policy matters simultaneously. By moving through Sabieh Anwar’s reflective journey, we feel that students, faculty members and academic administrators will all have considerable food for their thoughts.\n  The person that you are, was it your university or school education that helped you shape that way or was it the way you were brought up by your parents? You’ve given me a chance to reflect upon such vast topics, it’s a difficult task. My father is no more, but after his departure I feel more strongly about his deep impact on my life. I was in grade 3 when we came back to Lahore from England after my father’s PhD there. At first I was admitted to a famous English-medium school, it is still there and perhaps thousands of students are still studying there. But I remember that there was a ban on speaking in Urdu there, with a fine if one was caught speaking in it. But soon my father realized that I should be sent to a school where they inculcate a national spirit. I still remember these words of “milli jazba” from him even though we did not understand it back then. So he put me in Crescent Model School, where there were big grounds, morning assembly with Quranic recitation and national anthem, declamation contests in both Urdu and English, student societies and sports. The best teachers from my father’s alma mater, Central Model School, had joined Crescent after retirement, and I believe it was the best decision made by my father, as these teachers really shaped our hearts, minds and morals. And they did this all, silently, without preaching. We were taught English really well there, but equally well was the way we read Urdu, while our teachers even used references from Arabic and Farsi. There was no inferiority complex of any sort there, there was a strange self-confidence – the kind that does not border on obnoxious pride or elitism. In short, it was a beautiful schooling experience. Secondly, at home, our elders were those who just loved Pakistan, some had even participated in the Pakistan Movement, and that had a deep imprint on my being.\nAlso due to my father, I had a craze about Physics, to the extent that I opted to do both Matric as well as O-levels, since the traditional matriculations didn’t go into deeper conceptual spaces. Almost every year our school used to take the top Board positions, but that year even though I topped within the school, I was fourth in the Board. Everyone advised us to take the Board to the court, but once more my father made such an important intervention and made me look ahead and to move on. For my FSc I went to Government College but apart from my studies I took part in parliamentary style of debating, to the extent that I was chosen for representing Pakistan’s debating team and we even went to New Zealand to compete internationally. Again, it was my father who pushed me towards this, since my school days.\nAfter that when I wanted to do BSc in Physics, my father pushed me to do Electrical Engineering from UET instead, since there wasn’t any good university for basic Physics, and what a wonderful decision that was. During UET days we founded Khwarizmi Science Society which aimed to bring science to the public understanding to bridge the gap between students and science experts, and even to this day this society is alive and doing a wonderful job. My father never discouraged me from these activities, but he did bring a newspaper ad for Rhodes scholarship home one day, which I eventually received and went to Oxford after my undergrad. There I studied Physics to my heart’s content. We were at the cusp of Quantum computing in 2001 there.\nCompared to Pakistani universities, what was the experience of Oxford like, as a student? It seemed like heaven to me! There was so much to do all over the university. I spent so much time in libraries there. There’s a real treasure of knowledge in each of the big libraries in England, not just at Oxford. A nostalgic feeling takes over when I see our ancestral books also preserved in their libraries. I do believe that if for some reasonUK gets destroyed today, it can all be built back to its glory from just one of those libraries. Secondly, we were spoiled for choice when it came to seminars, almost every day, so much was happening outside the classes. Even our Pakistan Discussion Forum organized two events on Iqbal and Rumi. After Oxford, I went to Berkeley for my Postdoc for 2 years, and that was a wonderful experience as well. I thank God for being so kind to me.\nBut why were you studying so much? You did Matric and O levels in parallel, then BSc then Phd, and then even Postdoc. Was it a given that you’re going to become an academician? Yes, I had a romance with knowledge, with books, with Physics!\nYou’d have to expand on that as there’s certainly some confusions out there in the modern academia, as some good academicians are turning towards industry for higher salaries, and some are aiming for that while remaining within university, but you had some other ideals it seems, as you’ve used this term of “romance”.\nOther than the grip that the knowledge had on my being, I think I was in love with the act of teaching – imparting that knowledge to my students. I think my training in debating and oratory really helped me in my classes, as otherwise Physics could be a very dry subject. I love to teach, it’s a process of catharsis for me. Even if I’m tired after the drudgery of work, by the time I’m done with my class, I feel absolutely fresh. So, I’m in romance with not just the content of Physics, but also the act of imparting that knowledge to students. Secondly, I love the connections across the fields, e.g. the connection between Biology and Physics. The romance also comes from the “bigger picture” of Science or Physics, that of Schrodinger and Heisenberg, which Freeman Dyson terms as a bird’s eye view or “Shaheen’s” view. I love how Physics is so fundamental and it lets one think and know about one’s being, one’s history. All of it with such small vocabulary yet with such a world of meaning and expression. Would this not build nostalgia and romance?\nSince we’ve already transitioned into teaching, can you elaborate upon the choices you had to make after being done with Postdoc? For instance, you could have stayed in the West or could have joined a public university like your father but you chose a young small private university like LUMS. The decision of returning back to your roots is made before going outside, not when you’re there, so that was always the case with me. By God I tried getting into UET, but due to their policies I couldn’t fit anywhere as I had partly done Electrical Engineering and partly Physics. Also, during my interview at UET the VC asked me a non-technical question, and when I started answering in Urdu, he firmly interrupted, “Gentleman, in English please!”. Around 2006-7 when LUMS hadn’t yet started School of Science and Engineering (SSE) its project director visited Berkeley during my Postdoc, and invited me to apply to SSE. I gave a faculty talk at LUMS. Later, Dr. Asad Abidi of UCLA became SSE’s first dean, he invited me there and interviewed me and then gave me an offer for LUMS. LUMS turned out to be a great choice, its biggest factor has been freedom and a lack of strict hierarchy. I’m not the most senior professor at SSE and yet I’ve been elected as a Dean, so in this respect it is like the best universities of the West.\nSpeaking of the best universities, there’s a race for international rankings within Pakistani universities, and those who are faring far better than LUMS as far as the checklists and ranking formulae, are not the first choice of students and parents, like the way LUMS is. What is LUMS doing right that other universities of Pakistan are missing? I will speak on behalf of my own school of SSE. Our strength is our hiring. In Pakistan, our universities don’t have the right hiring mechanism worked out. On the one hand even if the best Pakistani PhD from MIT or Stanford wants to apply to Pakistani universities, he or she wouldn’t be able to work out a valid email address to send the CV to. On the other hand, the selection panel will have all sorts of irrelevant people like the VC of a university, high court’s judge, public service commission’s member, secretary education representative, and an arbitrary subject specialist. Which means, the right kind of judgment is not being done at the time of hiring. LUMS, on the other hand, does all it’s hard work at the time of hiring. We have around 100 faculty members at SSE now, and they are more or less all like-minded. We are passionate about teaching as well as research, and hence there’s equality amongst us.\nRanking is a qualitative affair, not a quantitative one completely, just like the relationship between a teacher and a student isn’t quantitative, just like learning isn’t a quantitative entity. And LUMS is qualitatively different from others. But I’ve seen this qualitative element at Namal, and at nascent stages of GIKI, at Habib, at QAU at one time. Faculty hiring and promotions, VC selection, these should all have qualitative elements, not just arbitrary assignment of quantitative marks per criteria. Like Nur-ud-din Zengi didn’t find Salahuddin Ayyubi through a quantitative process, you need that trusting qualitative ‘nazar’ to find what you’re looking for, at least at leadership level.\nLUMS has carved out its own selection process which is different from the one proposed by HEC policies, it seems. And it is surely working for you. What lets LUMS disagree with the principles set forth by various accreditation bodies? Even though we are a private university, we are not let off the hook completely by HEC or PEC. These accreditors have almost become a meta-university and all others a sub-campus of it. But whenever they become a hurdle in creativity, what is required by academic leadership is to rightly engage with the leadership of accreditation bodies, to present arguments to them with reason and respect. People at HEC and PEC have also studied in good universities, many from outside of Pakistan, but nobody tries really to engage with them, nobody even talks to them.\nI strongly believe that it is the old ideas that are holding back our universities. The whole world has moved on and insha’Allah we will find creative openings in our landscape too. At SSE we have almost a common first year across schools and students can make up their minds along the way.\nYou’re very hopeful about the future, even regarding our public universities and accreditation bodies, but unlike LUMS SSE which has a very qualitatively different approach to faculty hiring of like-minded individuals as a consequence of which academic freedom makes total sense, however, there are many other private universities that have already quantitatively hired a mixed bag of faculty members based on arbitrary paper publications etc, do you think think those departments and universities have hope? Are there any ingredients that if placed correctly at such a later stage can still set them off in the right direction? I believe small experiments like Namal or Austrian University at Haripur need to succeed. The VC or Rector needs to be a satiated person who has no ambitions for himself, and instead is kind, giving and capable as a leader. Then the core faculty hiring needs to be done very meticulously, as that is going to be the catalyst. Intentions are especially important in the beginning. There’s a need for ‘jawaano ko peeron ka ustaad kar’ so new people with new thoughts and new spirits need to be cherished without any political interference. At LUMS another great aspect is that there’s zero political intervention when it comes to student induction or faculty hiring and promotion etc. Even the President of Pakistan or PM or corps commander cannot do anything. These ingredients along with merit, transparency allow a place like LUMS to not be influenced by anybody else.\nThere are many universities in Pakistan much bigger than LUMS, where there’s wonderful faculty working, all they need is an exemplary leadership that is more interested in their faculty’s career development than their own. This kind of leadership cannot be produced through an MBA program. It can be produced through reading Iqbal, through reading Quran, through reading history, it can be inspired through a hero portrayed in a novel, it can be catalyzed by an event. The kind of leadership that can create Pakistan, that can construct our nuclear program, why can’t we have such leadership in universities? Within universities leaders need to be selected on merit, so they can become exemplary for everyone. We are naturally emotional and missionary, with exemplary leadership most of the faculty members will follow their leaders to wonderful spaces. The processes for head hunting VCs, deans and heads of departments need to change.\nYou had already found a pretty sound LUMS when you joined it, but coming to your phase of deanship now, is there any gap that you at the leadership of SSE want to fill still? The gap that I’m trying to bridge is our connection with Pakistan. Firstly, our message needs to reach out to others, but not as an elite looking down upon the rest, but just as a humble dissemination of whatever good idea we’re practicing. For this important mission, I’ve created a science communication cell, started off a website and videos. Language is important, I’ve asked all my MS and PhD theses to have an Urdu title as well as summary. I’ve also started communicating with policy makers in the same spirit. Secondly, I’m inspired by the need to integrate interdisciplinary areas such as brain or neuroscience and engineering. I want to create a center for clinical innovation that disrupts the silos of pre-medical and pre-engineering in Pakistan, where engineers and scientists can work and research in tandem with clinicians. If this barrier can’t be broken at LUMS or a private university, it’s very hard to imagine it happening anywhere else. I want to create deeper academic links of SSE with fringe areas such as archeology, astronomy, geology. We already have two computer scientists who have been hired in our Biology department.\nThere needs to be a buy-in from all your faculty members so that this wonderful vision of their dean could be achieved. Is it because of a democratic process through which you were elected as a dean that makes this possible? Even if one comes through as a result of a democratic process, he could still act dictatorially. As a dean I have to continuously be in a democratic dialogue with all my faculty in order that this vision becomes a reality. I have made two principles for myself as a dean: 1) I have to positively keep on surprising my faculty, by making their life easier without their asking for it, by enabling their research ideals, instead of bureaucratizing it. 2) I want to prioritize ideas that have a long-term impact. I want to give space to relevant as well as unusual research directions that don’t find home anywhere else. Lastly, I wish to see our faculty as well as students learning about learning.\n","date":1633564800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633564800,"objectID":"055a68dc880897e0e487d1759904fa7b","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast03-sabieh-anwar/","publishdate":"2021-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/podcast03-sabieh-anwar/","section":"post","summary":"Dr. Sabieh Anwar hardly needs any introduction in Pakistani academia, but Recompute.pk has taken a different perspective in this podcast.

Bilal Zafar is co-founder of 10XEngineers, a design services organization in the domain of computer engineering. Before that he was VP Engineering at Lampró Méllon, another design services company. But for most of his professional life he worked at QualComm in San Diego on custom and semi-custom implementation of chip designing. Anyone having a Samsung smartphone with a Snapdragon chip on it, is likely using technology that Bilal\u0026rsquo;s team had a hand in building. Before that, he did his PhD and postdoc at University of Southern California and BS at GIK Institute. In summary, he\u0026rsquo;s a competent and successful engineer, a product in part of Pakistan\u0026rsquo;s best university of his graduation era.\n  What exactly is the purpose of a university? It\u0026rsquo;s a badly phrased question, just as it\u0026rsquo;s a badly phrased question to be asked to identify what\u0026rsquo;s the universal purpose of an airline or a convenience store. There are many roles, it all depends on who\u0026rsquo;s opening the store, where it is being opened, what kind of customers are they targeting. Same is the case with universities: a university is a tool to do a certain number of things, and it\u0026rsquo;s up to the given university to identify which of the purposes it specifically wants to serve. For instance, LUMS with its 5000 students would have a very different set of aims and the services it provides in the society, when compared to Allama Iqbal Open university, with about 3 lac enrolled students. So, there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no comparison as these are two clearly different organizations, and it would be unfair to put them in any one bracket together. The only reason this question keeps popping up is because it is being asked by university professors who have a romantic notion of what a university ought to be, as opposed to a more utilitarian view.\nWhat does society want the university to be? If you want an unambiguous answer to the question you\u0026rsquo;d have to turn to the parents, the employers, the students, and they all would almost unanimously say that we want university to produce competent professionals who can get good jobs after university graduation, or that they should have a respectable stature in the society. So, if we look at the question from a pragmatic point of view, we\u0026rsquo;ll arrive at an answer on which the rest of the society will also be standing with us, otherwise if left to academicians who have way too many years inside a university, they will idealize and suggest that every university must be only like Harvard and Princeton. For instance, why isn\u0026rsquo;t India\u0026rsquo;s Indra Gandhi University not a role model, which produces more graduates every two years than all the Harvards and Princetons of the world combined. So, the contextual relevance needs to be clarified first. One of the largest university systems in the US is California community colleges, they don\u0026rsquo;t create knowledge per se, but their role is to produce the firemen, nurses, hairdressers, school teachers, and they are perfectly happy doing that service for the eighth largest GDP of the world. Hence, we must bracket this question so that we know which university is it that we\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\nFor American public universities it is important to spend money on sports, because their students say that it is sports that gives them identity, a sense of being part of a community, and this is true outside the walls of the public university for an ordinary citizen on the street, hence it gets translated within university as well. For instance, in USC, the head sports coach used to earn many times more than the university’s president, which means they know how to align everything once their identity and purpose of existence is clear. Similarly, in Pakistan there should be all sorts of universities, there should be LUMS and Quaid-e-Azam universities with focus on creating new knowledge \u0026ndash; we can\u0026rsquo;t say that just because we are a poor nation we should only provide vocational trainings \u0026ndash; and there should be UETs too, and they should serve their respective and distinct purposes in society, as long as cumulatively they create a strong, diverse ecosystem in Pakistan.\n3 Pakistani universities, 3 purposes, 3 stories: Bilal has had a chance, in Pakistani context, to think about this question of purpose of a university, for 3 different universities. One was GIKI, where he saw its best version as well as its downfall, and the question of purpose became an important question to trace the roots of the downfall. GIKI had absolute clarity of purpose \u0026ndash; to produce the best science and engineering professionals, and this purpose managed to seep into their people, processes and choices. The second time Bilal was made to think about this question was at the design stages of Habib University. Habib wanted to build a strong liberal arts and humanities foundations but for a common man, and it was Bilal’s who convinced them that this is not going to happen as a common man doesn\u0026rsquo;t want their kids to become a teacher with a great MA in English, they want them to become doctors or engineers. So, if one wants a true liberal arts undergrad, one should target the elites, so that instead of going outside Pakistan, they could get the same quality at Habib. The whole point is that once this purpose is clear, it is a perfectly legitimate service to Pakistan. The other option was to keep the liberal arts foundations, but the core degrees should be very narrow and specialized like engineering or computing etc, so that the technical side of the students is also employable and competitive in the job market, and Habib went for that. The third experience was at a private entity in Lahore, UCP, which mostly catered to the students belonging to small and medium scale business families, and hence about 25% of students at UCP opt for BBA, followed by CS. UCP is purely a profit making enterprise, hence the vision for UCP becomes very different, and its focus should be to make these students better businessmen as most of them are going to go back to their father\u0026rsquo;s or uncle\u0026rsquo;s shops or factories. In other words, UCP\u0026rsquo;s focus should be to improve its students’ business and ethical competencies that will help in their actual businesses. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if they\u0026rsquo;ve studied liberal arts. For Habib on the other hand, their students come from a financially sounder background, hence it makes sense that their vision is more focused on turning their students into risk-taking entrepreneurs.\nAlignment as first principle: It is not too hard an exercise to do and does not require decades of leg work, especially for universities who have been around for decades. It just needs a clear-eyed view of what they\u0026rsquo;ve mainly been doing, and that\u0026rsquo;s their vision and their role in society. For example, it is impossible to imagine that Punjab University wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know at this stage the kind of role they\u0026rsquo;ve been playing in Pakistan. Secondly, there needs to be an alignment between the owner and the current vice chancellor. That\u0026rsquo;s about it, if these two ingredients are in place, the rest of the alignment can follow even overnight. Unlike Harvards and Princetons of the world, most of Pakistani universities don\u0026rsquo;t have lengthy red tapes or tedious processes to take care of. Here even the HEC\u0026rsquo;s chairman can be changed overnight, so the whole process of alignment shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take 25 years for us.\nWhy hasn’t Pakistan produced world class universities? The biggest problem is not regarding curriculum or textbooks. According to Bilal, Pakistan\u0026rsquo;s biggest problem is an acute dearth of professional competent individuals. To run a big, complicated country you need lots of competent professionals in all domains. Same is the case with the individuals and teams in universities or accreditor bodies responsible for curriculum design - they just are not competent enough to do their jobs. So, they end up replicating what they had studied perhaps 30 years ago, meanwhile the international industry keeps moving ahead. Amidst this famine of competency, Pakistan can have one or at most 4 LUMS-type institutions, not 178, and that\u0026rsquo;s the worrying structural problem! Though we can\u0026rsquo;t have 178 LUMS, surely we could have had 4 with the kind of output LUMS is producing. But don’t even have that because good, competent faculty members are disbursed and distributed in various universities. In addition to the structural problem, the institutional problem stems from the fact that perhaps there\u0026rsquo;s only one Syed Babar Ali in Lahore, one Habib group in Karachi. If we have more such people who are concerned about education, perhaps they can collect the distributed talent again. One recent example is how Umar Saif tried at ITU by gathering quality people and resources, to produce quality output. But this would solve the problem for a total of 4 Pakistani universities at best, the rest of them would remain the same, all aiming at ranking formulae instead of quality output.\nWhy don’t good foreign qualified Pakistanis come back? Then there\u0026rsquo;s one more practical issue, in the form of limits to the spirit of nationalism. A standard university in Pakistan would offer a starting salary of about $1000 to a fresh PhD, that\u0026rsquo;s $12,000 per year. Someone like Bilal may be offered $15,000 per month outside Pakistan. This translates into absolutely different qualities of life, including kids’ education, health, security etc. But given this sharp diagnosis, does Bilal have any advice for those who have decided to stay in Pakistan, positively building forward?\nAdvice for a faculty member:\nThe ideal of having a purpose and its alignment even applies to an individual. Any faculty member sitting in any university has to bring together his purpose, the resources available and his best strengths. For instance, someone can be very good at teaching. If that is the case, then that faculty member has to be at peace with not having much \u0026ldquo;impact factor\u0026rdquo; or having delayed promotions, and if he persists through this, he\u0026rsquo;ll feel fulfilled eventually. Same is the case with those who feel they are good at research. Some faculty members should reach out to a couple of good software houses and ask the professionals there to teach him as to what they want from university students, learn from their meetings, from their processes, and he should go back to university and teach the CS students what he\u0026rsquo;s learnt. In return he can at least solve the 20% of employment problem, as those software houses are bound to employ his students. So, playing to one\u0026rsquo;s strengths and callings should always work.\nAdvice for a departmental head:\nBilal’s team is trying an experiment as a solution, one that bridges the gap between what the university produces and what the industry needs. It requires 3-4 months of remedial work, in the form of re-teaching fresh graduates courses that are fundamental to microprocessor chips designing. Because the related industry didn\u0026rsquo;t really exist in Pakistan previously, courses like digital logic design, computer architecture, data structures, embedded programming and systems weren\u0026rsquo;t streamlined in engineering universities and consequently most of EE or even computer engineering students didn\u0026rsquo;t take these courses seriously as they all wanted to major in Power or Telecom sector. This teaching of fundamentals can easily be done in a better and focused way in academia instead of them having to do this as remedial work. This is precisely the job of a head of department, to figure out the strengths of his department\u0026rsquo;s faculty, map it to a few industries, put his best resources and faculty together and purposefully streamline their set of courses that lead to a direct industry employment for the students, while being in direct communication with the industry all the time - from course and sub-curriculum design to monthly progress of student learning portfolios. For example, UET and Mentor Graphics have successfully done this.\nAdvice for an accreditor and university head:\nIf the university and department can guarantee that it is fulfilling a certain demand of the industry successfully up to graduate placement, then that is really it, they don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about catering to generic program requirements. Perhaps your students wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to get into a masters program, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay. But this requires guts and clarity of thought in university heads, because a typical accreditor would inquire about one missing course or another, just because in their own undergrad they took that. E.g. it is an outdated concept that all electrical engineers have to know controls theory, communications theory, signal processing, logic design etc. Thankfully, unlike EE\u0026rsquo;s accreditation bodies and employability issues, computer science is fortunate that it does not have a stringent PEC equivalent and on the other end, the software industry is very vibrant. So especially those universities who have smaller batch sizes, they should be able to align their purpose and objective with their output.\nAdvice for industry and academic higher-ups:\nPakistan\u0026rsquo;s technical higher education problem cannot be solved from the supplier side. It is physically impossible to pump more resources and technically competent people inside universities and solve the problem, it will be solved by the demand side. An industry that demands high quality graduates, demands that graduates should know certain things and then rewards them for that, i.e. if there is such a student, a great job is guaranteed, that\u0026rsquo;s how the problem will be solved. Right now, the students don\u0026rsquo;t believe that if they know their stuff, they\u0026rsquo;ll get a good job.\nAdvice for a rockstar faculty member:\nThe most competent faculty members who are great in academia as well as industry, should get into industry and help build the demand side more, as there are so many kinds of things possible in the software world right now.\nA word for ReCompute.pk: Bilal is of the opinion that we definitely need discourse generating, focused journalism on science as well as higher education, as it would be a great alternative to typical 7-9pm tv talk shows. Most of the young generation is now streaming different content on social media. The mass media\u0026rsquo;s dominant format is that of highlighting conflict, while in nature not everything is in conflict or needs to be presented as such. ReCompute podcasts is such an effort, creating and curating constructive conversations for the academia.\n","date":1629936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629936000,"objectID":"0588b16260660df0d364627c8bc08fe3","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast02-bilal-zafar/","publishdate":"2021-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/podcast02-bilal-zafar/","section":"post","summary":"Why Bilal?

But he\u0026rsquo;s also experienced being a student and researcher in France, Sweden, China, Singapore and Russia. As a teacher, he has experienced working at 5 Pakistani universities, and has been involved in curriculum development at departmental level as well.\n  Why Aamir? This profile makes Aamir a great choice for giving us a cross-sectional tour of a computer science teacher who is simultaneously bound by department\u0026rsquo;s curricular choices as well as university\u0026rsquo;s culture and priorities, while cross comparing with \u0026lsquo;baahir ki universities.\u0026rsquo; Secondly, Aamir being an idealist, always is cognizant of the fact that there is a difference between what is happening in our universities and what ought to be. He\u0026rsquo;ll unfold both within this conversation.\nPurpose of education: To make ourselves a better human being, and to make the world where we\u0026rsquo;re placed a better place to live in. But more recently, we\u0026rsquo;ve left this purpose behind and are more focused on skills, tied to monetary terms.\nPurpose of CS Education: In CS education, we can easily see the technical side of the things, and how they are related to making the world a technological convenience for a common man, but on the ethical side, or the higher purposes of education, or the humanities side of the curriculum, there is a glaring gap at the moment. Though there are some courses in CS curriculum in that direction, but neither the university nor the students take those courses seriously, as all the focus is placed on technical courses, lopsidedly. His undergrad\u0026rsquo;s Pakistan Studies teacher left an impact on Aamir, so he clearly sees the significance of non-technical courses for shaping students. One way to bridge the gap is to introduce a historical context within the content of technical courses as well, instead of just teaching the finished models. This will help develop process thinking in students.\nState of Pakistani universities: 4 years is a sufficient time for training and producing a graduate in whose personality the objectives of the institution should be visible, just like it is with the army personnel, but unfortunately in Pakistani universities those objectives aren\u0026rsquo;t clear.\nDifference between our and international universities: At the moment the Pakistani universities are neither producing thoughtful citizens nor competent technicians. But what is amiss here? Aamir said that Russian, French, or even Chinese universities have a national vision for education, aligned with their national missions. In schools and then even in universities, the teachers as well as students are very serious about achieving those objectives, resulting in students and teachers engaged in labs day and night. Russia and some other countries are bringing computational thinking down to early schooling levels even. Like gym instructors, senior professors are training students for maths and computing Olympiads, in the process polishing students' problem solving skills. When Russian university in which Aamir was based, prioritized research over other aspects, there were big scientist names all around the students to look up to.\nPushing past symptoms and getting to the root causes: Even those countries that are not as planned and controlled a state as the socialist blocks, for instance America, Canada, UK etc, where individual and academic freedom triumphs, even they have done incredibly well in science and technology, what is the case with Pakistan? Aamir cites a dialogue from Lewis Carol\u0026rsquo;s Alice in Wonderland, \u0026lsquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to go, you can take any path.\u0026rsquo; We have policy makers, curriculum designers, accreditation councils but they don\u0026rsquo;t know where to take our education system, resulting in arbitrariness and loop holes. For example, in one university, in the 8th and last semester it was decided that the students must be taught introduction to data science, but the same students had already studied Big data analytics in the 4th semester. To top it, the teacher is asked only to teach the theory within class, without dedicating any support resources for programming or Anaconda labs.\nIn Sweden, when they have decided that faculty workload is to be distributed 80% for research and 20% for teaching and administration, then they provide lots of creative teaching and administrative support for the professor, even for that 20%, and for the 80%, they provide utter solitude spaces where the professors can relax and do their thinking, lost in their own worlds. It\u0026rsquo;s in this environment that university\u0026rsquo;s purpose of creation of knowledge gets realized. Meanwhile in Pakistan, at the hiring stage, a mix of teaching and publication abilities are judged, and then almost without any teaching and administrative support, faculty member is made to teach 3-4 courses every semester, and yet at the end of the year faculty members are appraised based on research output, for which neither space not time was ensured by the university in the first place. This confusion in the administration eventually seeps to the students through teachers. Strangely, in this Pakistani environment, top \u0026ldquo;researchers\u0026rdquo; are also often those who are deeply involved in administrative affairs. Russia has kept this adaptive behaviour at bay by having separate teaching and research tracks and objectives.\nPositively moving forward for improving CS education: Unlike these great nations, we have to admit that Pakistan has no national level vision 2030 or 2050. This results in every government cooking up arbitrary policies, similarly HEC hands out various policies, while the confusion deepens. But we can\u0026rsquo;t really wait and do nothing till that visionary day finally arrives. Pragmatically speaking, what can good CS faculty members decide to do in their departments or courses for their students, despite the known issues elaborated above? Aamir had great practical tips:\nJust ensure rigor in two things: programming skills and analytical/problem solving sills. Do this in every course, e.g. even discrete maths course should have lots of programming assignments. Students as well as the industry would welcome the positive effect this consistent effort would create in the long run.\nAnother pragmatic solution for at least producing great software engineers for the industry by current universities is to set a much higher passing criteria for the core computing courses, programming fundamentals, algorithms etc. Secondly, if the teacher himself or herself has weak programming skills, the industry will keep getting frustrated.\nWe thank Aamir for such an insightful conversation, and giving simultaneous food for thought for policy makers, curriculum developers, heads of institutions and departments as well as faculty members and students. We hope that these meaningful conversations blossom into fruitful national level discourse.\n","date":1617408000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617408000,"objectID":"07ff0c45cb976b5254e282abcb26082e","permalink":"https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/april-03-2021-chat-with-aamir/","publishdate":"2021-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/april-03-2021-chat-with-aamir/","section":"post","summary":"Aamir Shahzad has studied at NUST and LUMS in Pakistan.
