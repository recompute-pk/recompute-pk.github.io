      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;generally-the-industrys-standpoint-is-that-computer-science-programs-in-pakistan-arent-producing-the-kind-of-graduates-that-it-requires-is-that-our-fundamental-problem&#34;&gt;Generally, the industry’s standpoint is that computer science programs in Pakistan aren’t producing the kind of graduates that it requires. Is that our fundamental problem?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umar Suleman (US)&lt;/em&gt; The problem is real. There are about 10,000 new jobs in the software industry per annum, and there are about 20,000 graduates being produced, but at max about 1000 of them are employable. This is a deficit, but also simultaneously, a great opportunity for us, the educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;are-most-of-these-1000-employable-graduates-concentrated-in-a-handful-of-universities-or-spread-around-uniformly-if-concentrated-then-what-could-be-the-reason-for-that&#34;&gt;Are most of these 1000 employable graduates concentrated in a handful of universities or spread around uniformly? If concentrated, then what could be the reason for that?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;US&lt;/em&gt; They are concentrated, and the reason is that in those universities the traditional education or educationist-first principle is relatively still intact. Ideally, if you want to address the education crisis in Pakistan, one recipe is that the teachers in private universities should be given at least a semblance of respect that the owners of the universities currently have. For instance, when the owner solves a problem by bending or breaking the stated rules, the way he is praised for thinking outside the box, if the same attitude is meted to teachers, then it would be a teacher’s or education-first institute. The over-emphasis on research, at the cost of teaching is also a sign that institutional priority isn’t education-first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;should-there-be-some-universities-that-should-focus-more-on-research-and-some-on-teaching&#34;&gt;Should there be some universities that should focus more on research and some on teaching?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;US&lt;/em&gt; For me, this is a premature question to ask at this stage, in terms of our cultural progression. First comes a new body of knowledge always, for instance once upon a time it was the fundamental knowledge around metallurgy, then comes the scale of skillful individuals within the culture that gives birth to genuine money-making industries, and once those genuine industries start facing genuine issues, however small their problems might be, the culture needs to have its best brains ready for this stage’s problem solving. This does not mean that this is a strictly linear model and that there are no exceptions to it. At the more mature stage of growth, the civilization needs to have pure research-based universities, but before that happens, the best brains of a culture ought to be given a respectful, dignified home within the current universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-take-sarfraz-onboard-as-well-before-we-head-towards-potential-solutions-as-to-what-he-thinks-is-the-fundamental-problem&#34;&gt;Let’s take Sarfraz onboard as well, before we head towards potential solutions, as to what he thinks is the fundamental problem.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarfraz Raza (SR)&lt;/em&gt; To me, much more than the need to ensure dignity for teachers, is the need to ensure dignity for our students. To make up for their incompetence, some teachers degrade their students and their questions in strange ways. Of course, students are lagging, but since the teachers are in power, that’s why in my view they are a bigger problem, with the smallness of their priorities and university politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;since-it-appears-that-what-umar-suleman-was-saying-was-absolutely-true-teachers-first-and-yet-what-you-are-saying-is-also-absolutely-true-teachers-ought-to-put-their-house-in-order-first-how-do-you-reconcile-between-the-positions&#34;&gt;Since it appears that what Umar Suleman was saying was absolutely true (teachers-first), and yet what you are saying is also absolutely true (teachers ought to put their house in order first), how do you reconcile between the positions?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SR&lt;/em&gt; I’m hopeless to a large extent as far as the faculty environment in university goes, but I’m still very hopeful as far as our students are concerned. For instance, during Covid, in my online course offering, when the students started going quiet on me and stopped interacting, after my persistent enquiry from them, they finally opened up with me. I came to know that most of the teachers are not even using the whiteboard technology or even the tabs that the university provided to them. Instead of adapting and learning something new, teachers are pushing everything onto slides. Students are getting depressed while they are rightfully finding it impossible to concentrate on the boring content and pedagogy. Teachers are not checking the assignments on time; hence the students are clueless about their learning progress. This makes the students tune out even in good classes. But perhaps the teachers have also tuned out because their universities have started expecting an unrealistic quantity of research and services from them besides teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;umar-i-hope-this-doesnt-turn-into-a-chicken-and-egg-problem-as-to-what-comes-first&#34;&gt;Umar, I hope this doesn’t turn into a chicken and egg problem, as to what comes first.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;US&lt;/em&gt; It isn’t. Principles don’t follow a linear progression stepwise; principles are timeless in that sense. And it is a principle that a teacher ought to be given respect and honor, and the decision-makers in universities need to adhere to this principle. But connecting it to Sarfraz’ point, it seems that the teacher also ought to remain cognizant of the fact that he or she is to have the deepest respect in the whole society, and he or she better act likewise, to ensure that that remains the case. Teaching is a special designation that demands respect, much more than other cadres of the society, and it’s also important to know why there’s respect for this designation – it is not because of research, it’s not even because of knowledge. It is because of the long-term and defining service to the community through changing the minds and futures of students. Such a teacher, who recognizes this role, would treat students accordingly. Amongst my own teachers I still deeply respect those few who were selfless and more concerned about their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wonderfully-put-can-we-shift-to-how-you-have-set-up-your-programming-fundamentals-course-what-are-its-fundamental-ingredients&#34;&gt;Wonderfully put. Can we shift to how you have set up your programming fundamentals course? What are its fundamental ingredients?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;US&lt;/em&gt; My experience has forced me to the conclusion that if a student has good foundation in just 3 courses from the first 3 semesters, programming fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and data structures/algorithms, then it’s almost impossible for the student to have a bad industry career, and on the flip side if a student has had bad foundations in these 3 courses, then it’s almost impossible to have a great industry career. As soon as this was evident to me, I forgo my graduate level and elective level courses and by choice opted to teach these foundational courses within my university – at the cost of publishing through grad students. In my view, the ideal teachers for these foundational courses should be expert programmers themselves, who are bigger than even the best programming books out there. Pedagogy wise, the course should be problem-based rather than topic-based, i.e. it should be done through posing the problem in front of the students, and collectively solving the problems within the class, and only then embedding the teaching of programming constructs within these solution designs. For example, selling the students the idea of putting a frame around a 2D face image, instead of teaching them abstractly about 2D arrays or loops. Thirdly, to develop a habit, the course is centered around problem solving both within the class and associated assignments outside the shared lecture hours, resulting in 20 + assignments in a single course. But the most important ingredient for me is the development of a faculty of comprehension within the students, i.e., they must imagine the computational abstractions and connections between them within their heads before coding, just based on their teacher’s verbal narratives. This is done through a dialogical process. For the development of this fundamental faculty, it is imperative that the students aren’t shown too many visualizations up front. I show them actual snippets of code only eventually and to only cement the psychological impressions in the students’ head that their teacher is at the top of his programming game. Once this faculty of comprehension is strengthened (and it is often a painful process,) it goes a long way, up to their final year project and later in industry.
&lt;em&gt;SR&lt;/em&gt; In one aspect, my emphasis is absolutely the same as Umar Suleman’s. My course is also entirely problem based, I don’t teach loop etc. But where I disagree is that my course is entirely through live coding in front of students in an IDE. It is because of my own bad first encounter with programming when I was a fresh undergrad student. Pseudocode and flowcharts never worked for me. I usually start my course with MIT’s visual programming language called Scratch, hence the students learn programming through the instant visual effect of their code blocks on a visual object. The best programmers are eventually those who, over time, have developed the same muscle or faculty that Umar Suleman mentioned – they can predict more correctly and more often the effect of their code before hitting the Run button. Just like Umar I also believe that I have to inspire my students in every class, but my translation of that term is that my students should look at their teacher as a super problem solver and a super programmer, one they would like to emulate. For that, they have to witness, in every class, their teacher solving problems and programming in front of them, as much as possible. This includes, at times, writing wrong code and getting stuck and then maneuvering collectively out of the issue programmatically. This includes learning and teaching the art of debugging using a debugger, and this can’t be achieved by teaching only through pen and paper. All information regarding my course is publicly accessible online for anyone’s viewing, which also shows how we shift from Scratch to C++, and the kind of problems we solve every week, and the online teaching resources I employ, and how we move from small building blocks to bigger problem breakdown. The whole point is that just like a small kid cannot learn the human language if the adults aren’t talking in the kid’s presence, similarly, when it comes to learning a programming language, it will have to be a similar kind of immersive experience, where the kids are witnessing their elder(s) use the programming language every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dr-umar-we-can-readily-appreciate-when-you-said-that-working-the-computational-problem-solving-muscle-in-your-students-mind-comes-before-actual-coding-hence-the-choice-of-paper-and-pen-makes-sense-but-what-sarfraz-said-about-programming-language-being-an-immersive-experience-also-makes-total-sense-hence-the-choice-of-live-coding-and-debugging-inside-the-classroom-how-do-you-reconcile-the-two&#34;&gt;Dr. Umar, we can readily appreciate when you said that working the computational problem-solving muscle in your students’ mind comes before actual coding, hence the choice of paper and pen makes sense, but what Sarfraz said about programming language being an immersive experience also makes total sense, hence the choice of live coding and debugging inside the classroom. How do you reconcile the two?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;US&lt;/em&gt; Debugging isn’t about placing a breakpoint. They’ll be placing the breakpoint at all the wrong places if they don’t have the complete detailed picture of their program and its logic in their mind first. Debugging is again, in the head first, and if the student has learnt how to use his or her own mind as a computer, and that is precisely what is the faculty that I want to build in my students, then they’ll be able to sniff or trace either through a breakpoint or some other means, as to the origin of the bug. I demonize the error in my class, as it’s a sign that the students have written the code without solving the problem first.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;SR&lt;/em&gt; I completely agree that even debugging has to take place in the mind first, but I would like to emphasize that for very large programs, or distributed applications, it’s imperative to have good hands-on debugging skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;any-parting-thoughts&#34;&gt;Any parting thoughts?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SR&lt;/em&gt; I’ve recently started using leetcode, where the students can submit their code as solutions to my chosen problem instances and at its backend the leetcode service runs tons of unit test cases on the code submission, and let’s them know which test cases have failed. It also tells them the overall global rank of their submission. It’s important because our students only test their codes very weakly.
&lt;em&gt;US&lt;/em&gt; In my opinion, there is a psychological tendency when you, as a teacher, throw too many online resources at your students, that you can discharge yourself from the responsibility of guarding your students’ future well-being as a programmer, i.e., if they don’t become a great resource for the industry you could say that it’s not your fault, because you had given them a whole world of resources. So, my parting thought is once again that the teacher should be at the center of everything that happens in the course. In our tradition, a teacher is a person who takes the pain – the pain of taking his students’ responsibility, not just in one course, but forever. In my living experience, the most impact-creating teachers have only been those who have never let anything else in their lives muddle this perspective. For if this perspective is intact, then everything that Sarfraz and I do in our class will matter to students, otherwise a teacher can add a whole lot of methodologies or tools to make the course interesting, it will not have the same impact on their students or their lives!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReCompute with Syed Zulfiqar Gilani | Everything from the origins of HEC to the latest attempts at revamping undergrad curriculum | Podcast # 5</title>
      <link>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast05-zulfiqar-gilani/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast05-zulfiqar-gilani/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zulfiqar Gilani is a psychologist by training, and has worked in US and Canada as a clinical psychologist for many years. He came back to Pakistan intending to retire, but in 2001 General Musharraf formulated a task force which was to work at devising a vision for improving the higher education in Pakistan. It was co-chaired by Syed Babar Ali and Dr. Zulfiqar was a member of that task force as well as the chair of the sub-committee on vision and governance of universities. The conception of HEC came from that task force. One of the recommendations of the task force was that there should be an integrated 4-year undergraduate program in Pakistan. This podcast of Recompute wants to explore the history, process and current status of the “revamping of undergraduate curriculum 2020” project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fAM-gOHNFA4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;where-did-the-curricular-revamping-idea-emerge-from&#34;&gt;Where did the curricular revamping idea emerge from?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was Vice-Chancellor of Peshawar University from 2000-2004 where I had started working on building the required integrated undergraduate curriculum, and in the meantime HEC had been officially formed in 2002. As soon as HEC sent out the notification to all universities to restructure their undergrad programs, what almost every university in Pakistan did was to combine their two-year BA and two year MA degrees into one 4 year semester-based program. I refused to do that as VC of Peshawar University, because in the initial HEC task force we really believed that the whole curriculum framework needs to be restructured so that it can meet certain objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-was-really-amiss-in-the-on-going-programs-and-curriculum-that-the-need-for-restructuring-was-felt-so-strongly-by-you&#34;&gt;What was really amiss in the on-going programs and curriculum that the need for restructuring was felt so strongly by you?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be very practical. Barring a few students, our undergraduates were getting out with degrees for sure but none of them had acquired any worthwhile skills or competencies required of them along the way. Since I had taught in the US as well as in England, I saw the quality of undergraduates there. For a vast majority of first-world undergraduates, they don’t need to study any further, undergrad is their last degree. Whereas, in Pakistan, the piece of paper students get at the end of 16 years of education is almost valueless when they go into the market hunting for jobs. On the other hand, the capacity or potential that I saw even in Peshawar University students was at par with their counterpart students across the world. This was the same basic issue at hand that became the starting point for a need for restructuring the undergraduate curriculum at the time when HEC was formulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more recently, when Tariq Banuri became the chairman HEC, he asked me what I wanted to do, and I knew exactly that we needed to revamp the core backbone of higher education – the undergraduate program. At the moment this backbone is very weak, as it gives not very useful employees to the industry, and feeds weak future-teachers to Masters, MPhil and PhD programs, creating a vicious cycle. Anyway, after rejoining HEC I asked around about the undergraduate policy in place. This was around Jan 2019, and I received a 2-pager document. It was basically a 2 year + 2 year formula, with some patch-on courses labeled as General Education courses. And they were not General Education courses at all. I tried, in vain, to get hold of any minutes of the meetings or the process through which this 2-pager policy was arrived at – I couldn’t get hold of a single such document. Thereon, I initiated a long and tedious process of meetings and consultations with important stakeholders of academia, including faculty, registrars, VCs etc. and it was heartening to know that they unanimously agreed that the current undergraduate curriculum isn’t producing the kind of successful, useful, educated individuals that the world needs – someone with technical competencies and who can have a conversation about important things in life, and who has a sense of what is going on in the world. An engineer needs to really know what the philosophers and historians have been saying, and the medical students should also be mathematically cultured. So, this is what drove us to revamp the old status-quo of single-subject focused narrow system. Now we have documentation from all of those consultation and dialogue meetings which gave birth to the revamped undergrad policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-what-happened-between-the-inception-of-the-integrated-curriculum-idea-around-2001-and-2019-how-was-the-status-quo-of-the-22-formula-set-in-place&#34;&gt;But what happened between the inception of the integrated curriculum idea around 2001 and 2019. How was the status-quo of the 2+2 formula set in place?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HEC just put this 2+2 template without providing any training or technical resources for how to do assessments in a semester system, for example. Secondly, and much more horribly, what was actually instituted was the creation of special allowances - all research focused: if you have a PhD you get x amount of allowance, if you publish a paper, y amount, if you supervise a PhD, z allowance etc. What this institutionalization did was to take the meaning out of what is called research, as the motivational structure got reduced to this single measurable KPI for hiring and promotion etc. This not only gave birth to plagiarism and fake journals, but more importantly, it pushed the faculty to ignore teaching, as they were being rewarded only for their research output. I have overwhelming anecdotal evidence from all my HEC consultations where almost everyone said that after the officiating of HEC, the quality of undergraduate education in Pakistan has gotten worse, as all the focus got shifted to graduate and postgraduate level. All of this confusion was a consequence of misplaced priorities, which translated to faculty policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-if-the-quality-of-undergraduate-education-in-pakistan-has-deteriorated-because-of-lopsided-faculty-policies-or-the-lack-of-teachers-training-then-why-blame-it-all-on-the-poor-curriculum-and-why-only-change-the-curricular-structure&#34;&gt;But if the quality of undergraduate education in Pakistan has deteriorated because of lopsided faculty policies or the lack of teachers’ training, then why blame it all on the poor curriculum, and why only change the curricular structure?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll candidly confess that we could have begun from a lot of starting points, but we began from revamping the curriculum framework, because frankly speaking, I was the one doing it. Had it been someone else, they could have started with designing teachers’ training, or another individual could have started with university and faculty regulations and policies. I do believe that starting from curriculum is a good choice, as one has to begin from somewhere, and also because the rest of the things can be aligned with the spirit of this curricular change. I’m an optimistic person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;its-a-pleasant-surprise-that-you-did-not-find-any-resistance-from-university-stakeholders-or-faculty&#34;&gt;It’s a pleasant surprise that you did not find any resistance from university stakeholders or faculty!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t even blame our university faculty members who do not understand this kind of balanced undergrad, as they received a specialized subject-focused undergrad when they were students, while the best parts of the developed world had taught a holistic, balanced set of courses to their undergrad students. After receiving a specialized undergrad, most of our current faculty members went outside Pakistan for Masters and PhDs, which in any case, are specialized programs. So, it is no surprise that the kind of undergraduate program we have designed has not been experienced by most of our faculty. But in our defense, we are not reinventing the wheel at all. What works wonderfully for the better parts of the world, we are only helping create the same experience for our dear undergraduate students, so they can also become useful, conscientious citizens of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;can-you-elaborate-upon-some-of-the-salient-features-of-this-new-revamped-undergrad-policy&#34;&gt;Can you elaborate upon some of the salient features of this new revamped undergrad policy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foremost shift from the subject-focused previous era is that this is a student-centered policy. By that I mean that a student should be able to take admission in a university and only later on decide about the program or major based on an informed decision, as undergrad is a perfect stage in one’s life for self-exploration. Student-centered also means that we are investing in students’ long-term success, and for qualifying as a thoughtful and useful member of the modern civilization we are making the students go through a series of courses in the first couple of years. These general education courses actually promise the breadth that is the hallmark of an undergraduate education worldwide: courses from humanities such as philosophy, history, creative arts; courses from social sciences such as psychology, sociology, economics, political science; courses from natural sciences such as geology, ecology; courses that teach quantitative reasoning in today’s data-intensive world; there are also courses focused on language and writing skills; finally civilizational studies that teach about the origins of Islam as well as origins of Pakistan. Thirdly, the revamped policy especially asks the universities to teach practical and professional skills to students formally, by taking student societies and internships more seriously. These are some of the fundamental pillars on which the holistic framework stands. Understanding each pillar’s significance and their inter-relatedness is the key for moving forward. I know there are logistical issues around admissions and accreditation bodies, but while we have already devised creative alternatives for some of the logistical issues, compromising on the spirit of the holistic framework is a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;staying-true-to-the-letter-and-spirit-of-the-new-policy-are-there-any-creative-workarounds-for-very-large-and-very-old-establishments-especially-the-large-public-universities&#34;&gt;Staying true to the letter and spirit of the new policy, are there any creative workarounds for very large and very old establishments, especially the large public universities?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re already thinking of relaxing the policy for admissions to university; for instance, an engineering related student can be admitted to a specific school, but there should be proper transfer mechanisms in place if the student later wants to transfer to any other program, school wide or university wide, given that the student has done well in related General education courses, in 12th grade, and in related admission test components. Secondly, instead of pushing all the 12-13 general education courses in the first 2 or so semesters, we are okay if some of the courses are spread across the 4 years, creating more room for subject-specific courses early on as well. Lastly, even though we have defined the spirit of each general education course, and also rolled out their model course outlines, but staying true to the definitions of sub-categories, spirit of the policy and also to the two guiding principles of the policy – freedom of expression and academic honesty – any university can create their own set of general education courses. One public university, NUST, and some of the good private universities like LUMS at Lahore, Habib at Karachi and Namal at Mianwali were already working along similar curricular directions before we launched this revamping of undergraduate education policy. But bear in mind, HEC has the mandate to improve the higher education quality across the entire country. I wish other universities also creatively embrace the change keeping in view the long-term success of their students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;speaking-of-creativity-perhaps-another-way-to-inculcate-the-historical-lens-within-students-could-have-been-to-design-every-course-even-the-technical-ones-such-that-it-touches-historical-perspective-within-its-content-instead-of-teaching-just-one-course-on-history-separately-is-that-too-ideal-for-hec&#34;&gt;Speaking of creativity, perhaps another way to inculcate the historical lens within students could have been to design every course, even the technical ones, such that it touches historical perspective within its content, instead of teaching just one course on history separately. Is that too ideal for HEC?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons I don’t want to go into, most of our faculty has lost the ability of designing and developing proper syllabi. Most of our faculty takes one textbook, and chapter by chapter copying or mapping of the textbook becomes the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;if-this-is-the-unfortunate-state-of-affairs-of-the-majority-that-is-going-to-deliver-this-new-revamped-undergraduate-curriculum-how-have-you-ensured-that-the-same-history-is-not-going-to-repeat-itself-with-the-previous-22-formula-and-despite-almost-all-universities-fulfilling-ranking-bodies-checklists-number-of-phds-departments-course-offerings-research-papers-etc-they-were-obviously-failing-to-produce-quality-students-how-will-the-situation-of-treating-this-new-revamped-set-of-ideals-as-just-another-hec-imposed-checklist-change&#34;&gt;If this is the unfortunate state of affairs of the majority that is going to deliver this new revamped undergraduate curriculum, how have you ensured that the same history is not going to repeat itself? With the previous 2+2 formula, and despite almost all universities fulfilling ranking bodies’ checklists (number of PhDs, departments, course offerings, research papers etc), they were obviously failing to produce quality students. How will the situation of treating this new revamped set of ideals as just another HEC imposed checklist change?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you a few examples of what HEC is doing differently this time around. The World Bank has approached us and with their support, the idea to develop learning objectives based milestones, year-wise, to go hand in hand with the revamped curriculum is underway. Secondly, with Tariq Banuri at the helm of affairs, I have one person who completely understands this project, and wants to see it succeed. He formed the Post-secondary Education Reform Unit, which I’m heading. So, in parallel to designing the curriculum, we are designing capacity building activities for faculty, focused on pedagogy. We’re tying this up with the World Bank agreement. Another very important capacity building exercise is focused on policy implementation. These supplementary exercises need to be carried out in a systematic manner, going forward. But having said this, I still believe that the younger lot of faculty members within our universities, once given this fresh curricular perspective, will channel their positive creative forces in the right direction, to effect a positive change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;just-like-hec-is-thinking-of-capacity-building-regarding-curriculum-policy-implementation-dont-you-think-that-hec-also-needs-to-revamp-the-faculty-policies-in-order-to-make-the-revamped-curriculum-a-success-as-the-lopsided-selection-appraisal-and-promotion-policies-have-taken-the-emphasis-within-universities-away-from-teaching-a-solid-undergraduate-program-and-faculty-members-are-forced-by-these-lopsided-policies-to-give-more-time-to-their-masters-and-phd-students-in-order-to-prove-their-research-worthiness&#34;&gt;Just like HEC is thinking of capacity building regarding curriculum policy implementation, don’t you think that HEC also needs to revamp the faculty policies in order to make the revamped curriculum a success, as the lopsided selection, appraisal and promotion policies have taken the emphasis within universities away from teaching a solid undergraduate program, and faculty members are forced by these lopsided policies to give more time to their Masters and PhD students, in order to prove their research-worthiness?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect Dr. Tariq Banuri a lot, as he’s a man of integrity and a true intellectual, and with him at the helm of affairs we have already been talking about these issues, and thinking of a 40-40-20 framework, which is an international norm. The policies, departments and faculty members give 40 percent weight to teaching as well as their research scholarship and 20 percent to their university services. Right now, there is no policy, almost everyone is counting the number of publications. In an ideal world, every faculty should be able to have his/her own contract based on different weightages assigned to teaching, research and services, but since I have also served as a bureaucrat in my past, I do know the importance of bureaucracy in any organization, but I also know that wherever the bureaucratic efficacy takes precedence over the purpose and mission of the organization things start deteriorating, which is what has happened to Pakistani universities, as well as HEC. In this regard, HEC, again in collaboration with the World Bank, is going to revamp the Quality Enhancement Cells (QEC) within universities, as they have only become quantity and administration-focused, interventionist and monitoring cells, which isn’t really helping the cause of education. It seems that everyone has lost sight of the fact that in a university, the most important stakeholder is the student, then the faculty, then the administration and VCs, and HEC and accreditors are at the very bottom – not the other way around. We are developing the right set of ToRs to reset QECs’ direction within universities. With these supplementary revamps, it is hoped that the curricular revamp will be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to highlight again that in addition to curricular changes, the implementation of the new policy requires universities to establish three new offices: office of academic advisement for students, office of internship and placement, and office of extra-curricular activities. HEC has already allocated and rolled out a budget to 16 universities for the establishment of these offices within their campuses. I know that the best private universities in Pakistan have been those who already have had their focus on these 3 areas before HEC asked them to revamp. For the rest of Pakistan, we have asked the universities to get their houses in order till Fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;we-believe-our-dialogue-today-has-converged-wonderfully-to-the-conclusion-that-hec-could-have-initiated-the-process-of-change-from-any-one-of-a-number-of-aspects-but-curriculum-seems-to-be-just-the-right-choice-with-this-and-with-the-supplementary-capacity-building-exercises-in-the-pipeline-it-is-hoped-that-universities-will-take-further-required-steps-in-the-right-direction-and-align-their-qecs-and-faculty-policies-to-the-effect-of-making-this-curricular-change-a-success-for-themselves-and-their-students&#34;&gt;We believe our dialogue today has converged wonderfully to the conclusion that HEC could have initiated the process of change from any one of a number of aspects, but curriculum seems to be just the right choice. With this, and with the supplementary capacity building exercises in the pipeline, it is hoped that universities will take further required steps in the right direction and align their QECs and faculty policies to the effect of making this curricular change a success for themselves and their students!&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>ReCompute with Khalid Latif | Academia: Quality vs Process, Admin Support | Industry Skills | Podcast # 4</title>
      <link>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast04-khalid-latif/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast04-khalid-latif/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Noman came across Khalid Latif as his senior in his university at Bahawalpur where Khalid had kickstarted a final exam boycott movement. This was intriguing, as historically, most of the student-led strikes were for non-academic issues at that time. Khalid begins ReComputing by shedding more light on that event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YICb8exZQU4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most universities, the blue-eyed faculty members get to teach their chosen courses, while at the time of the course allocation, the rest of the courses are distributed whimsically by their HoDs. So when that happens, and if the teacher does not have the will or competency to make additional effort to learn a new subject, he’ll dance, i.e. he’ll pass time while making sure that the students are happy. Sometimes this dance even includes revealing the final exam prior to the day of exam. Surely, this dance makes most of the students happy most of the time, but it didn’t work for Khalid Latif; and after he talked to other studious class-fellows they all agreed that they deserve better than this, and that this isn’t even an evaluation. As soon as they got the paper (same as revealed by the teacher earlier) they returned the empty answer sheets and were almost proud of the creative and silent way of their protest, but were shocked to know that the university administration did propaganda against the students at first, and when that failed, they failed to take any action against the way the course and exam had been conducted. Nevertheless, Khalid Latif and the batch got the message across to the other side successfully, which at least got them thinking for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;usually-the-theetas-marks-maximizers-in-universities-are-the-last-people-to-show-any-semblance-of-activism-on-the-other-hand-they-are-often-seen-ditching-positive-causes-at-the-last-moments-what-made-you-take-an-unconventional-route&#34;&gt;Usually the ‘theetas’ (marks maximizers) in universities are the last people to show any semblance of activism. On the other hand, they are often seen ditching positive causes at the last moments. What made you take an unconventional route?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was never a ‘theeta.’ I was just in love with computer science, even though my father and all his contacts “advised” me how there is going to be no life if I don’t study chemistry or do pre-engineering. However, I just spent my days programming in BASIC language and getting fascinated by it. I only started taking marks seriously when I realized that I need good marks in FSc in order to get admission in computer science programs. In short, I never associated myself with the top GPA band, I was driven by my love for computing instead. In contrast, today’s university students are also protesting their exams, but sadly for very wrong reasons – perhaps because students aren’t doing computer science out of their passion, but rather because they were forced to make that choice by their elders.
Speaking of unconventional routes, we were also part of an underground movement, where a bunch of our senior alumni who were doing great jobs in Lahore’s software houses were coaching the juniors for developing great final year projects. These sessions took place all night long and were so helpful in creating the software engineers that our university couldn’t, even out of those students who were less passionate about cs, perhaps because of senior-junior relationship. I wish that circle could have kept going after us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;you-were-all-geared-up-for-a-great-career-in-industry-and-you-did-join-it-initially-but-then-suddenly-we-heard-the-news-of-you-joining-academia-can-you-tell-us-what-made-you-interested-in-a-university-life&#34;&gt;You were all geared up for a great career in industry, and you did join it initially, but then suddenly, we heard the news of you joining academia. Can you tell us what made you interested in a university life?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I wasn’t interested! My mother kept pushing me to come back from Lahore to Bahawalpur, and there was this opening at a university at Bahawalpur. I finally gave in even though my interest wasn’t in teaching but in programming. However, I soon realized that I could produce students who’d be great at programming. And the day I got to know that one of my students landed a job with double the salary as mine, I really fell in love with my profession. Some years later, I also went for PhD to Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-different-in-austrian-universities-when-compared-with-pakistani-universities&#34;&gt;What’s different in Austrian universities, when compared with Pakistani universities?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every university across the world, there’s always people fighting for resources, be it financial or human or compute resources. But while in Austria I saw the fight taking place positively, in Pakistan, the fight is negative. The reason is that in Austria, faculty members were striving for excellence in an area of their domain, and in Pakistan people want the resources to highlight themselves and to get themselves promoted. In Austria, faculty members aren’t too focused on becoming a full professor asap, but they want to be known as an expert in their area. That’s why you’ll find many wonderful faculty members in European universities who aren’t full professors, but in Pakistan you’ll find many full professors who haven’t attained their academic potential, but they have managed to attain the positions. I’ve known and met a 50 years old lecturer from New Zealand who is amazing as well as satisfied with what he’s contributing. One way out of this negative politics is to stop having a fixed quota for the number of associate and full professor seats a department can have, so that people stop gravitating around power and concentrate on their own academic interests. We tried bringing this to SEECS.
Second marked difference was that in Austria there were clearly distinct teaching and research career tracks for faculty members, and both kinds of personalities were cherished within the system. There were associate and full professors who weren’t bringing in any funding but were teaching more than 2 courses a semester, and did an excellent job at that. In Pakistan, there’s a single formula for promotion and since the number of publications has taken over as a metric, faculty members have started to neglect teaching. One solution is to have separate career progression tracks for teaching as well as research, to create a dignified and enabling environment within the university. We placed 3 separate criteria for faculty profiles at NUST: a research, a teaching and a hybrid model, and faculty members chose their own tracks.
We were lucky that like-minded faculty members got together at SEECS and we were allowed to bring in new ideas by our administration. HEC could still play a positive role to promote a more enabling environment within universities, but unfortunately, they’ve reduced everything to the number of publications. Instead, if HEC starts ranking or funding universities according to the employability of their students, it would be a much more fruitful design, just like it is a requirement in getting Abbot’s accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-important-is-the-role-of-the-administrative-support-or-is-the-comradeship-of-like-minded-faculty-members-sufficient&#34;&gt;How important is the role of the administrative support or is the comradeship of like-minded faculty members sufficient?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial, moral, and other forms of support from administration is a pre-requisite for an enabling environment, but a prerequisite to that is the will in the faculty members to think in terms of a bigger picture, one that transcends their personal profiles and appraisals. Also, the faculty members should sometimes put themselves in the administration’s shoes and be creative enough to sustain alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;given-all-the-like-minded-support-from-faculty-as-well-as-administration-why-did-you-leave-academia-and-went-back-to-industry&#34;&gt;Given all the like-minded support from faculty as well as administration, why did you leave academia and went back to industry?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011 when I was at NUST, I had a chance to collaborate with an international startup, Biome Analytics, who were interested in improving clinical decision making inside hospitals. This kind of applied research, that actually improved the lives of kidney patients, instead of just writing academic papers, reminded me of why I always wanted to be in computing – to be able to make useful value addition systems, for people. Eventually, I left academia and joined them full time. I do the kind of research in data science and machine learning that I love, and it gives me immense satisfaction that our decision support systems are actually being used within hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-industry-looking-for-in-university-graduates&#34;&gt;What is industry looking for in university graduates?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know for a fact from my network that there’s a mammoth demand for quality computing graduates - those who have problem solving skills. Even if a candidate knows only C++ and zero Python, we can give him even 2-3 months for bridging that or any other technical gap, given that he has an appetite for analyzing and understanding problems and can trace the root of an issue that needs fixing, and lastly can design a potential solution to fix the root causes. Our organization has many novice programmers but who are excellent in solving and tracing computational problems whenever encountered. It seems that the universities aren’t instilling this skill set in their students, unfortunately, so the industry has to invest in training to make up for it. There was a time when FAST-Lahore was known in Pakistan as the number 1 computer science institution from employers’ perspective, and that was because in almost all courses in their stream they rigorously kept throwing problems from various angles towards their students, so the students, by the end of their degree were well exposed and experienced in problem solving; even their maths courses had programming rigor. Pedagogically, the teachers shouldn’t only throw an algorithm at students, but also let them grasp where this algorithm is going to be applied as a solution to a problem. This might slow down the course, or cover less content eventually, but if any university applies this principle consistently in all their courses, their graduates will be highly sought after in the industry. I know companies who are looking to even hire whole batches if the students have such problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReCompute with Sabieh Anwar | Romance of Knowledge | Staying rooted | What LUMS gets right | Podcast # 3</title>
      <link>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast03-sabieh-anwar/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast03-sabieh-anwar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sabieh Anwar hardly needs any introduction in Pakistani academia, but Recompute.pk has taken a   different perspective in this podcast. We went through a reflective cross section of his life, first when he was a student, then his phase as a young scholar or a faculty member joining a university in Pakistan, and finally his experience as a dean of an important STEM school at LUMS. We sincerely think that any faculty member who wants to do anything creative and meaningful in his or her teaching, no doubt, must bring that element in the classroom in front of the students, but has also to creatively deal with departmental constraints and the wider university culture and policy matters simultaneously. By moving through Sabieh Anwar’s reflective journey, we feel that students, faculty members and academic administrators will all have considerable food for their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/guVlo2SOWcw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-person-that-you-are-was-it-your-university-or-school-education-that-helped-you-shape-that-way-or-was-it-the-way-you-were-brought-up-by-your-parents&#34;&gt;The person that you are, was it your university or school education that helped you shape that way or was it the way you were brought up by your parents?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve given me a chance to reflect upon such vast topics, it’s a difficult task. My father is no more, but after his departure I feel more strongly about his deep impact on my life. I was in grade 3 when we came back to Lahore from England after my father’s PhD there. At first I was admitted to a famous English-medium school, it is still there and perhaps thousands of students are still studying there. But I remember that there was a ban on speaking in Urdu there, with a fine if one was caught speaking in it. But soon my father realized that I should be sent to a school where they inculcate a national spirit. I still remember these words of “milli jazba” from him even though we did not understand it back then. So he put me in Crescent Model School, where there were big grounds, morning assembly with Quranic recitation and national anthem, declamation contests in both Urdu and English, student societies and sports. The best teachers from my father’s alma mater, Central Model School, had joined Crescent after retirement, and I believe it was the best decision made by my father, as these teachers really shaped our hearts, minds and morals. And they did this all, silently, without preaching. We were taught English really well there, but equally well was the way we read Urdu, while our teachers even used references from Arabic and Farsi. There was no inferiority complex of any sort there, there was a strange self-confidence – the kind that does not border on obnoxious pride or elitism. In short, it was a beautiful schooling experience. Secondly, at home, our elders were those who just loved Pakistan, some had even participated in the Pakistan Movement, and that had a deep imprint on my being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also due to my father, I had a craze about Physics, to the extent that I opted to do both Matric as well as O-levels, since the traditional matriculations didn’t go into deeper conceptual spaces. Almost every year our school used to take the top Board positions, but that year even though I topped within the school, I was fourth in the Board. Everyone advised us to take the Board to the court, but once more my father made such an important intervention and made me look ahead and to move on. For my FSc I went to Government College but apart from my studies I took part in parliamentary style of debating, to the extent that I was chosen for representing Pakistan’s debating team and we even went to New Zealand to compete internationally. Again, it was my father who pushed me towards this, since my school days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that when I wanted to do BSc in Physics, my father pushed me to do Electrical Engineering from UET instead, since there wasn’t any good university for basic Physics, and what a wonderful decision that was. During UET days we founded Khwarizmi Science Society which aimed to bring science to the public understanding to bridge the gap between students and science experts, and even to this day this society is alive and doing a wonderful job. My father never discouraged me from these activities, but he did bring a newspaper ad for Rhodes scholarship home one day, which I eventually received and went to Oxford after my undergrad. There I studied Physics to my heart’s content. We were at the cusp of Quantum computing in 2001 there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;compared-to-pakistani-universities-what-was-the-experience-of-oxford-like-as-a-student&#34;&gt;Compared to Pakistani universities, what was the experience of Oxford like, as a student?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like heaven to me! There was so much to do all over the university. I spent so much time in libraries there. There’s a real treasure of knowledge in each of the big libraries in England, not just at Oxford. A nostalgic feeling takes over when I see our ancestral books also preserved in their libraries. I do believe that if for some reasonUK gets destroyed today, it can all be built back to its glory from just one of those libraries. Secondly, we were spoiled for choice when it came to seminars, almost every day, so much was happening outside the classes. Even our Pakistan Discussion Forum organized two events on Iqbal and Rumi.
After Oxford, I went to Berkeley for my Postdoc for 2 years, and that was a wonderful experience as well. I thank God for being so kind to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-why-were-you-studying-so-much-you-did-matric-and-o-levels-in-parallel-then-bsc-then-phd-and-then-even-postdoc-was-it-a-given-that-youre-going-to-become-an-academician&#34;&gt;But why were you studying so much? You did Matric and O levels in parallel, then BSc then Phd, and then even Postdoc. Was it a given that you’re going to become an academician?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I had a romance with knowledge, with books, with Physics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d have to expand on that as there’s certainly some confusions out there in the modern academia, as some good academicians are turning towards industry for higher salaries, and some are aiming for that while remaining within university, but you had some other ideals it seems, as you’ve used this term of “romance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the grip that the knowledge had on my being, I think I was in love with the act of teaching – imparting that knowledge to my students. I think my training in debating and oratory really helped me in my classes, as otherwise Physics could be a very dry subject. I love to teach, it’s a process of catharsis for me. Even if I’m tired after the drudgery  of work, by the time I’m done with my class, I feel absolutely fresh. So, I’m in romance with not just the content of Physics, but also the act of imparting that knowledge to students. Secondly, I love the connections across the fields, e.g. the connection between Biology and Physics. The romance also comes from the “bigger picture” of Science or Physics, that of Schrodinger and Heisenberg, which Freeman Dyson terms as a bird’s eye view or “Shaheen’s” view. I love how Physics is so fundamental and it lets one think and know about one’s being, one’s history. All of it with such small vocabulary yet with such a world of meaning and expression. Would this not build nostalgia and romance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;since-weve-already-transitioned-into-teaching-can-you-elaborate-upon-the-choices-you-had-to-make-after-being-done-with-postdoc-for-instance-you-could-have-stayed-in-the-west-or-could-have-joined-a-public-university-like-your-father-but-you-chose-a-young-small-private-university-like-lums&#34;&gt;Since we’ve already transitioned into teaching, can you elaborate upon the choices you had to make after being done with Postdoc? For instance, you could have stayed in the West or could have joined a public university like your father but you chose a young small private university like LUMS.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision of returning back to your roots is made before going outside, not when you’re there, so that was always the case with me. By God I tried getting into UET, but due to their policies I couldn’t fit anywhere as I had partly done Electrical Engineering and partly Physics. Also, during my interview at UET the VC asked me a non-technical question, and when I started answering in Urdu, he firmly interrupted, “Gentleman, in English please!”. Around 2006-7 when LUMS hadn’t yet started School of Science and Engineering (SSE) its project director visited Berkeley during my Postdoc, and invited me to apply to SSE. I gave a faculty talk at LUMS. Later, Dr. Asad Abidi of UCLA became SSE’s first dean, he invited me there and interviewed me and then gave me an offer for LUMS. LUMS turned out to be a great choice, its biggest factor has been freedom and a lack of strict hierarchy. I’m not the most senior professor at SSE and yet I’ve been elected as a Dean, so in this respect it is like the best universities of the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;speaking-of-the-best-universities-theres-a-race-for-international-rankings-within-pakistani-universities-and-those-who-are-faring-far-better-than-lums-as-far-as-the-checklists-and-ranking-formulae-are-not-the-first-choice-of-students-and-parents-like-the-way-lums-is-what-is-lums-doing-right-that-other-universities-of-pakistan-are-missing&#34;&gt;Speaking of the best universities, there’s a race for international rankings within Pakistani universities, and those who are faring far better than LUMS as far as the checklists and ranking formulae, are not the first choice of students and parents, like the way LUMS is. What is LUMS doing right that other universities of Pakistan are missing?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will speak on behalf of my own school of SSE. Our strength is our hiring. In Pakistan, our universities don’t have the right hiring mechanism worked out. On the one hand even if the best Pakistani PhD from MIT or Stanford wants to apply to Pakistani universities, he or she wouldn’t be able to work out a valid email address to send the CV to. On the other hand, the selection panel will have all sorts of irrelevant people like the VC of a university, high court’s judge, public service commission’s member, secretary education representative, and an arbitrary subject specialist. Which means, the right kind of judgment is not being done at the time of hiring. LUMS, on the other hand, does all it’s hard work at the time of hiring. We have around 100 faculty members at SSE now, and they are more or less all like-minded. We are passionate about teaching as well as research, and hence there’s equality amongst us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking is a qualitative affair, not a quantitative one completely, just like the relationship between a teacher and a student isn’t quantitative, just like learning isn’t a quantitative entity. And LUMS is qualitatively different from others. But I’ve seen this qualitative element at Namal, and at nascent stages of GIKI, at Habib, at QAU at one time. Faculty hiring and promotions, VC selection, these should all have qualitative elements, not just arbitrary assignment of quantitative marks per criteria. Like Nur-ud-din Zengi didn’t find Salahuddin Ayyubi through a quantitative process, you need that trusting qualitative ‘nazar’ to find what you’re looking for, at least at leadership level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lums-has-carved-out-its-own-selection-process-which-is-different-from-the-one-proposed-by-hec-policies-it-seems-and-it-is-surely-working-for-you-what-lets-lums-disagree-with-the-principles-set-forth-by-various-accreditation-bodies&#34;&gt;LUMS has carved out its own selection process which is different from the one proposed by HEC policies, it seems. And it is surely working for you. What lets LUMS disagree with the principles set forth by various accreditation bodies?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we are a private university, we are not let off the hook completely by HEC or PEC. These accreditors have almost become a meta-university and all others a sub-campus of it. But whenever they become a hurdle in creativity, what is required by academic leadership is to rightly engage with the leadership of accreditation bodies, to present arguments to them with reason and respect. People at HEC and PEC have also studied in good universities, many from outside of Pakistan, but nobody tries really to engage with them, nobody even talks to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that it is the old ideas that are holding back our universities. The whole world has moved on and insha’Allah we will find creative openings in our landscape too. At SSE we have almost a common first year across schools and students can make up their minds along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;youre-very-hopeful-about-the-future-even-regarding-our-public-universities-and-accreditation-bodies-but-unlike-lums-sse-which-has-a-very-qualitatively-different-approach-to-faculty-hiring-of-like-minded-individuals-as-a-consequence-of-which-academic-freedom-makes-total-sense-however-there-are-many-other-private-universities-that-have-already-quantitatively-hired-a-mixed-bag-of-faculty-members-based-on-arbitrary-paper-publications-etc-do-you-think-think-those-departments-and-universities-have-hope-are-there-any-ingredients-that-if-placed-correctly-at-such-a-later-stage-can-still-set-them-off-in-the-right-direction&#34;&gt;You’re very hopeful about the future, even regarding our public universities and accreditation bodies, but unlike LUMS SSE which has a very qualitatively different approach to faculty hiring of like-minded individuals as a consequence of which academic freedom makes total sense, however, there are many other private universities that have already quantitatively hired a mixed bag of faculty members based on arbitrary paper publications etc, do you think think those departments and universities have hope? Are there any ingredients that if placed correctly at such a later stage can still set them off in the right direction?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe small experiments like Namal or Austrian University at Haripur need to succeed. The VC or Rector needs to be a satiated person who has no ambitions for himself, and instead is kind, giving and capable as a leader. Then the core faculty hiring needs to be done very meticulously, as that is going to be the catalyst. Intentions are especially important in the beginning. There’s a need for ‘jawaano ko peeron ka ustaad kar’ so new people with new thoughts and new spirits need to be cherished without any political interference. At LUMS another great aspect is that there’s zero political intervention when it comes to student induction or faculty hiring and promotion etc. Even the President of Pakistan or PM or corps commander cannot do anything. These ingredients along with merit, transparency allow a place like LUMS to not be influenced by anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many universities in Pakistan much bigger than LUMS, where there’s wonderful faculty working, all they need is an exemplary leadership that is more interested in their faculty’s career development than their own. This kind of leadership cannot be produced through an MBA program. It can be produced through reading Iqbal, through reading Quran, through reading history, it can be inspired through a hero portrayed in a novel, it can be catalyzed by an event. The kind of leadership that can create Pakistan, that can construct our nuclear program, why can’t we have such leadership in universities? Within universities leaders need to be selected on merit, so they can become exemplary for everyone. We are naturally emotional and missionary, with exemplary leadership most of the faculty members will follow their leaders to wonderful spaces. The processes for head hunting VCs, deans and heads of departments need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;you-had-already-found-a-pretty-sound-lums-when-you-joined-it-but-coming-to-your-phase-of-deanship-now-is-there-any-gap-that-you-at-the-leadership-of-sse-want-to-fill-still&#34;&gt;You had already found a pretty sound LUMS when you joined it, but coming to your phase of deanship now, is there any gap that you at the leadership of SSE want to fill still?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap that I’m trying to bridge is our connection with Pakistan. Firstly, our message needs to reach out to others, but not as an elite looking down upon the rest, but just as a humble dissemination of whatever good idea we’re practicing. For this important mission, I’ve created a science communication cell, started off a website and videos. Language is important, I’ve asked all my MS and PhD theses to have an Urdu title as well as summary. I’ve also started communicating with policy makers in the same spirit. Secondly, I’m inspired by the need to integrate interdisciplinary areas such as brain or neuroscience and engineering. I want to create a center for clinical innovation that disrupts the silos of pre-medical and pre-engineering in Pakistan, where engineers and scientists can work and research in tandem with clinicians. If this barrier can’t be broken at LUMS or a private university, it’s very hard to imagine it happening anywhere else. I want to create deeper academic links of SSE with fringe areas such as archeology, astronomy, geology. We already have two computer scientists who have been hired in our Biology department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;there-needs-to-be-a-buy-in-from-all-your-faculty-members-so-that-this-wonderful-vision-of-their-dean-could-be-achieved-is-it-because-of-a-democratic-process-through-which-you-were-elected-as-a-dean-that-makes-this-possible&#34;&gt;There needs to be a buy-in from all your faculty members so that this wonderful vision of their dean could be achieved. Is it because of a democratic process through which you were elected as a dean that makes this possible?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if one comes through as a result of a democratic process, he could still act dictatorially. As a dean I have to continuously be in a democratic dialogue with all my faculty in order that this vision becomes a reality. I have made two principles for myself as a dean: 1) I have to positively keep on surprising my faculty, by making their life easier without their asking for it, by enabling their research ideals, instead of bureaucratizing it. 2) I want to prioritize ideas that have a long-term impact. I want to give space to relevant as well as unusual research directions that don’t find home anywhere else. Lastly, I wish to see our faculty as well as students learning about learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReCompute with Bilal Zafar | Types and roles of universities, importance of purpose alignment, working with the industry | Podcast # 2</title>
      <link>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast02-bilal-zafar/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/podcast02-bilal-zafar/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-bilal&#34;&gt;Why Bilal?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilal Zafar is co-founder of 10XEngineers, a design services organization in the domain of computer engineering. Before that he was VP Engineering at Lampró Méllon, another design services company. But for most of his professional life he worked at QualComm in San Diego on custom and semi-custom implementation of chip designing. Anyone having a Samsung smartphone with a Snapdragon chip on it, is likely using technology that Bilal&amp;rsquo;s team had a hand in building. Before that, he did his PhD and postdoc at University of Southern California and BS at GIK Institute. In summary, he&amp;rsquo;s a competent and successful engineer, a product in part of Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s best university of his graduation era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7W7rn9DLeT0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-exactly-is-the-purpose-of-a-university&#34;&gt;What exactly is the purpose of a university?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a badly phrased question, just as it&amp;rsquo;s a badly phrased question to be asked to identify what&amp;rsquo;s the universal purpose of an airline or a convenience store. There are many roles, it all depends on who&amp;rsquo;s opening the store, where it is being opened, what kind of customers are they targeting. Same is the case with universities: a university is a tool to do a certain number of things, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the given university to identify which of the purposes it specifically wants to serve. For instance, LUMS with its 5000 students would have a very different set of aims and the services it provides in the society, when compared to Allama Iqbal Open university, with about 3 lac enrolled students. So, there&amp;rsquo;s absolutely no comparison as these are two clearly different organizations, and it would be unfair to put them in any one bracket together. The only reason this question keeps popping up is because it is being asked by university professors who have a romantic notion of what a university ought to be, as opposed to a more utilitarian view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-does-society-want-the-university-to-be&#34;&gt;What does society want the university to be?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want an unambiguous answer to the question you&amp;rsquo;d have to turn to the parents, the employers, the students, and they all would almost unanimously say that we want university to produce competent professionals who can get good jobs after university graduation, or that they should have a respectable stature in the society. So, if we look at the question from a pragmatic point of view, we&amp;rsquo;ll arrive at an answer on which the rest of the society will also be standing with us, otherwise if left to academicians who have way too many years inside a university, they will idealize and suggest that every university must be only like Harvard and Princeton. For instance, why isn&amp;rsquo;t India&amp;rsquo;s Indra Gandhi University not a role model, which produces more graduates every two years than all the Harvards and Princetons of the world combined. So, the contextual relevance needs to be clarified first. One of the largest university systems in the US is California community colleges, they don&amp;rsquo;t create knowledge per se, but their role is to produce the firemen, nurses, hairdressers, school teachers, and they are perfectly happy doing that service for the eighth largest GDP of the world. Hence, we must bracket this question so that we know which university is it that we&amp;rsquo;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For American public universities it is important to spend money on sports, because their students say that it is sports that gives them identity, a sense of being part of a community, and this is true outside the walls of the public university for an ordinary citizen on the street, hence it gets translated within university as well. For instance, in USC, the head sports coach used to earn many times more than the university’s president, which means they know how to align everything once their identity and purpose of existence is clear. Similarly, in Pakistan there should be all sorts of universities, there should be LUMS and Quaid-e-Azam universities with focus on creating new knowledge &amp;ndash; we can&amp;rsquo;t say that just because we are a poor nation we should only provide vocational trainings &amp;ndash; and there should be UETs too, and they should serve their respective and distinct purposes in society, as long as cumulatively they create a strong, diverse ecosystem in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-pakistani-universities-3-purposes-3-stories&#34;&gt;3 Pakistani universities, 3 purposes, 3 stories:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilal has had a chance, in Pakistani context, to think about this question of purpose of a university, for 3 different universities. One was GIKI, where he saw its best version as well as its downfall, and the question of purpose became an important question to trace the roots of the downfall. GIKI had absolute clarity of purpose &amp;ndash; to produce the best science and engineering professionals, and this purpose managed to seep into their people, processes and choices.
The second time Bilal was made to think about this question was at the design stages of Habib University. Habib wanted to build a strong liberal arts and humanities foundations but for a common man, and it was Bilal’s who convinced them that this is not going to happen as a common man doesn&amp;rsquo;t want their kids to become a teacher with a great MA in English, they want them to become doctors or engineers. So, if one wants a true liberal arts undergrad, one should target the elites, so that instead of going outside Pakistan, they could get the same quality at Habib. The whole point is that once this purpose is clear, it is a perfectly legitimate service to Pakistan. The other option was to keep the liberal arts foundations, but the core degrees should be very narrow and specialized like engineering or computing etc, so that the technical side of the students is also employable and competitive in the job market, and Habib went for that.
The third experience was at a private entity in Lahore, UCP, which mostly catered to the students belonging to small and medium scale business families, and hence about 25% of students at UCP opt for BBA, followed by CS. UCP is purely a profit making enterprise, hence the vision for UCP becomes very different, and its focus should be to make these students better businessmen as most of them are going to go back to their father&amp;rsquo;s or uncle&amp;rsquo;s shops or factories. In other words, UCP&amp;rsquo;s focus should be to improve its students’ business and ethical competencies that will help in their actual businesses. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if they&amp;rsquo;ve studied liberal arts. For Habib on the other hand, their students come from a financially sounder background, hence it makes sense that their vision is more focused on turning their students into risk-taking entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;alignment-as-first-principle&#34;&gt;Alignment as first principle:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not too hard an exercise to do and does not require decades of leg work, especially for universities who have been around for decades. It just needs a clear-eyed view of what they&amp;rsquo;ve mainly been doing, and that&amp;rsquo;s their vision and their role in society. For example, it is impossible to imagine that Punjab University wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know at this stage the kind of role they&amp;rsquo;ve been playing in Pakistan. Secondly, there needs to be an alignment between the owner and the current vice chancellor. That&amp;rsquo;s about it, if these two ingredients are in place, the rest of the alignment can follow even overnight. Unlike Harvards and Princetons of the world, most of Pakistani universities don&amp;rsquo;t have lengthy red tapes or tedious processes to take care of. Here even the HEC&amp;rsquo;s chairman can be changed overnight, so the whole process of alignment shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take 25 years for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-hasnt-pakistan-produced-world-class-universities&#34;&gt;Why hasn’t Pakistan produced world class universities?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is not regarding curriculum or textbooks. According to Bilal, Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s biggest problem is an acute dearth of professional competent individuals. To run a big, complicated country you need lots of competent professionals in all domains. Same is the case with the individuals and teams in universities or accreditor bodies responsible for curriculum design - they just are not competent enough to do their jobs. So, they end up replicating what they had studied perhaps 30 years ago, meanwhile the international industry keeps moving ahead. Amidst this famine of competency, Pakistan can have one or at most 4 LUMS-type institutions, not 178, and that&amp;rsquo;s the worrying structural problem! Though we can&amp;rsquo;t have 178 LUMS, surely we could have had 4 with the kind of output LUMS is producing. But don’t even have that because good, competent faculty members are disbursed and distributed in various universities. In addition to the structural problem, the institutional problem stems from the fact that perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s only one Syed Babar Ali in Lahore, one Habib group in Karachi. If we have more such people who are concerned about education, perhaps they can collect the distributed talent again. One recent example is how Umar Saif tried at ITU by gathering quality people and resources, to produce quality output. But this would solve the problem for a total of 4 Pakistani universities at best, the rest of them would remain the same, all aiming at ranking formulae instead of quality output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-dont-good-foreign-qualified-pakistanis-come-back&#34;&gt;Why don’t good foreign qualified Pakistanis come back?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s one more practical issue, in the form of limits to the spirit of nationalism. A standard university in Pakistan would offer a starting salary of about $1000 to a fresh PhD, that&amp;rsquo;s $12,000 per year. Someone like Bilal may be offered $15,000 per month outside Pakistan. This translates into absolutely different qualities of life, including kids’ education, health, security etc. But given this sharp diagnosis, does Bilal have any advice for those who have decided to stay in Pakistan, positively building forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice for a faculty member:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal of having a purpose and its alignment even applies to an individual. Any faculty member sitting in any university has to bring together his purpose, the resources available and his best strengths. For instance, someone can be very good at teaching. If that is the case, then that faculty member has to be at peace with not having much &amp;ldquo;impact factor&amp;rdquo; or having delayed promotions, and if he persists through this, he&amp;rsquo;ll feel fulfilled eventually. Same is the case with those who feel they are good at research. Some faculty members should reach out to a couple of good software houses and ask the professionals there to teach him as to what they want from university students, learn from their meetings, from their processes, and he should go back to university and teach the CS students what he&amp;rsquo;s learnt. In return he can at least solve the 20% of employment problem, as those software houses are bound to employ his students. So, playing to one&amp;rsquo;s strengths and callings should always work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice for a departmental head:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilal’s team is trying an experiment as a solution, one that bridges the gap between what the university produces and what the industry needs. It requires 3-4 months of remedial work, in the form of re-teaching fresh graduates courses that are fundamental to microprocessor chips designing. Because the related industry didn&amp;rsquo;t really exist in Pakistan previously, courses like digital logic design, computer architecture, data structures, embedded programming and systems weren&amp;rsquo;t streamlined in engineering universities and consequently most of EE or even computer engineering students didn&amp;rsquo;t take these courses seriously as they all wanted to major in Power or Telecom sector. This teaching of fundamentals can easily be done in a better and focused way in academia instead of them having to do this as remedial work. This is precisely the job of a head of department, to figure out the strengths of his department&amp;rsquo;s faculty, map it to a few industries, put his best resources and faculty together and purposefully streamline their set of courses that lead to a direct industry employment for the students, while being in direct communication with the industry all the time - from course and sub-curriculum design to monthly progress of student learning portfolios. For example, UET and Mentor Graphics have successfully done this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice for an accreditor and university head:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the university and department can guarantee that it is fulfilling a certain demand of the industry successfully up to graduate placement, then that is really it, they don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about catering to generic program requirements. Perhaps your students wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to get into a masters program, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay. But this requires guts and clarity of thought in university heads, because a typical accreditor would inquire about one missing course or another, just because in their own undergrad they took that. E.g. it is an outdated concept that all electrical engineers have to know controls theory, communications theory, signal processing, logic design etc.
Thankfully, unlike EE&amp;rsquo;s accreditation bodies and employability issues, computer science is fortunate that it does not have a stringent PEC equivalent and on the other end, the software industry is very vibrant. So especially those universities who have smaller batch sizes, they should be able to align their purpose and objective with their output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice for industry and academic higher-ups:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s technical higher education problem cannot be solved from the supplier side. It is physically impossible to pump more resources and technically competent people inside universities and solve the problem, it will be solved by the demand side. An industry that demands high quality graduates, demands that graduates should know certain things and then rewards them for that, i.e. if there is such a student, a great job is guaranteed, that&amp;rsquo;s how the problem will be solved. Right now, the students don&amp;rsquo;t believe that if they know their stuff, they&amp;rsquo;ll get a good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advice for a rockstar faculty member:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most competent faculty members who are great in academia as well as industry, should get into industry and help build the demand side more, as there are so many kinds of things possible in the software world right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-word-for-recomputepk&#34;&gt;A word for ReCompute.pk:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilal is of the opinion that we definitely need discourse generating, focused journalism on science as well as higher education, as it would be a great alternative to typical 7-9pm tv talk shows. Most of the young generation is now streaming different content on social media. The mass media&amp;rsquo;s dominant format is that of highlighting conflict, while in nature not everything is in conflict or needs to be presented as such. ReCompute podcasts is such an effort, creating and curating constructive conversations for the academia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReCompute with Aamir Shahzad | Purpose of Education, Pakistani vs Foreign Universities, Root Causes | Podcast # 1</title>
      <link>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/april-03-2021-chat-with-aamir/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://recompute-pk.github.io/post/april-03-2021-chat-with-aamir/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aamir Shahzad has studied at NUST and LUMS in Pakistan. But he&amp;rsquo;s also experienced being a student and researcher in France, Sweden, China, Singapore and Russia. As a teacher, he has experienced working at 5 Pakistani universities, and has been involved in curriculum development at departmental level as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ei2_Y715J8I&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-aamir&#34;&gt;Why Aamir?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This profile makes Aamir a great choice for giving us a cross-sectional tour of a computer science teacher who is simultaneously bound by department&amp;rsquo;s curricular choices as well as university&amp;rsquo;s culture and priorities, while cross comparing with &amp;lsquo;baahir ki universities.&amp;rsquo; Secondly, Aamir being an idealist, always is cognizant of the fact that there is a difference between what is happening in our universities and what ought to be. He&amp;rsquo;ll unfold both within this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;purpose-of-education&#34;&gt;Purpose of education:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make ourselves a better human being, and to make the world where we&amp;rsquo;re placed a better place to live in. But more recently, we&amp;rsquo;ve left this purpose behind and are more focused on skills, tied to monetary terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;purpose-of-cs-education&#34;&gt;Purpose of CS Education:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In CS education, we can easily see the technical side of the things, and how they are related to making the world a technological convenience for a common man, but on the ethical side, or the higher purposes of education, or the humanities side of the curriculum, there is a glaring gap at the moment. Though there are some courses in CS curriculum in that direction, but neither the university nor the students take those courses seriously, as all the focus is placed on technical courses, lopsidedly. His undergrad&amp;rsquo;s Pakistan Studies teacher left an impact on Aamir, so he clearly sees the significance of non-technical courses for shaping students. One way to bridge the gap is to introduce a historical context within the content of technical courses as well, instead of just teaching the finished models. This will help develop process thinking in students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;state-of-pakistani-universities&#34;&gt;State of Pakistani universities:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 years is a sufficient time for training and producing a graduate in whose personality the objectives of the institution should be visible, just like it is with the army personnel, but unfortunately in Pakistani universities those objectives aren&amp;rsquo;t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;difference-between-our-and-international-universities&#34;&gt;Difference between our and international universities:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment the Pakistani universities are neither producing thoughtful citizens nor competent technicians. But what is amiss here? Aamir said that Russian, French, or even Chinese universities have a national vision for education, aligned with their national missions. In schools and then even in universities, the teachers as well as students are very serious about achieving those objectives, resulting in students and teachers engaged in labs day and night. Russia and some other countries are bringing computational thinking down to early schooling levels even. Like gym instructors, senior professors are training students for maths and computing Olympiads, in the process polishing students&#39; problem solving skills. When Russian university in which Aamir was based, prioritized research over other aspects, there were big scientist names all around the students to look up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pushing-past-symptoms-and-getting-to-the-root-causes&#34;&gt;Pushing past symptoms and getting to the root causes:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those countries that are not as planned and controlled a state as the socialist blocks, for instance America, Canada, UK etc, where individual and academic freedom triumphs, even they have done incredibly well in science and technology, what is the case with Pakistan? Aamir cites a dialogue from Lewis Carol&amp;rsquo;s Alice in Wonderland, &amp;lsquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to go, you can take any path.&amp;rsquo; We have policy makers, curriculum designers, accreditation councils but they don&amp;rsquo;t know where to take our education system, resulting in arbitrariness and loop holes. For example, in one university, in the 8th and last semester it was decided that the students must be taught introduction to data science, but the same students had already studied Big data analytics in the 4th semester. To top it, the teacher is asked only to teach the theory within class, without dedicating any support resources for programming or Anaconda labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sweden, when they have decided that faculty workload is to be distributed 80% for research and 20% for teaching and administration, then they provide lots of creative teaching and administrative support for the professor, even for that 20%, and for the 80%, they provide utter solitude spaces where the professors can relax and do their thinking, lost in their own worlds. It&amp;rsquo;s in this environment that university&amp;rsquo;s purpose of creation of knowledge gets realized. Meanwhile in Pakistan, at the hiring stage, a mix of teaching and publication abilities are judged, and then almost without any teaching and administrative support, faculty member is made to teach 3-4 courses every semester, and yet at the end of the year faculty members are appraised based on research output, for which neither space not time was ensured by the university in the first place. This confusion in the administration eventually seeps to the students through teachers. Strangely, in this Pakistani environment, top &amp;ldquo;researchers&amp;rdquo; are also often those who are deeply involved in administrative affairs. Russia has kept this adaptive behaviour at bay by having separate teaching and research tracks and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;positively-moving-forward-for-improving-cs-education&#34;&gt;Positively moving forward for improving CS education:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike these great nations, we have to admit that Pakistan has no national level vision 2030 or 2050. This results in every government cooking up arbitrary policies, similarly HEC hands out various policies, while the confusion deepens. But we can&amp;rsquo;t really wait and do nothing till that visionary day finally arrives. Pragmatically speaking, what can good CS faculty members decide to do in their departments or courses for their students, despite the known issues elaborated above? Aamir had great practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ensure rigor in two things: programming skills and analytical/problem solving sills. Do this in every course, e.g. even discrete maths course should have lots of programming assignments. Students as well as the industry would welcome the positive effect this consistent effort would create in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pragmatic solution for at least producing great software engineers for the industry by current universities is to set a much higher passing criteria for the core computing courses, programming fundamentals, algorithms etc. Secondly, if the teacher himself or herself has weak programming skills, the industry will keep getting frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank Aamir for such an insightful conversation, and giving simultaneous food for thought for policy makers, curriculum developers, heads of institutions and departments as well as faculty members and students. We hope that these meaningful conversations blossom into fruitful national level discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
